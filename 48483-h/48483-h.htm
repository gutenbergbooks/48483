      CHAPTER I. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>any, many weeks,
      months indeed have gone by since I opened this my journal. Can I bear the
      sight of it even now? Yes; I think I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been sitting ever so long at the open window, in my old attitude,
      elbow on the sill; only with a difference that seems to come natural now,
      when no one is by. It is such a comfort to sit with my lips on my ring. I
      asked him to give me a ring, and he did so. Oh! Max, Max, Max!
    </p>
    <p>
      Great and miserable changes have befallen us, and now Max and I are not
      going to be married. Penelope's marriage also has been temporarily
      postponed, for the same reason, though I implored her not to tell it to
      Francis, unless he should make very particular inquiries, or be
      exceedingly angry at the delay. He was not. Nor did we judge it well to
      inform Lisabel. Therefore, papa, Penelope, and I, keep our own secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that it is over, the agony of it smothered up, and all at Rockmount
      goes on as heretofore, I sometimes wonder, do strangers, or intimates,
      Mrs. Granton for instance, suspect anything? Or is ours, awful as it
      seems, no special and peculiar lot? Many another family may have its own
      lamentable secret, the burthen of which each member has to bear, and carry
      in society a cheerful countenance, even as this of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton said yesterday, mine was &ldquo;a cheerful countenance.&rdquo; If so, I
      am glad. Two things only could really have broken my heart&mdash;his
      ceasing to love me, and his changing so in <i>himself</i>, not in his
      circumstances, that I could no longer worthily love him. By &ldquo;him,&rdquo; I mean,
      of course Max. Max Urquhart, my betrothed husband, whom henceforward I can
      never regard in any other light.
    </p>
    <p>
      How blue the hills are, how bright the moors! So they ought to be, for it
      is near midsummer. By this day fortnight&mdash;Penelope's marriage-day&mdash;we
      shall have plenty of roses. All the better; I would not like it to be a
      dull wedding, though so quiet; only the Trehernes and Mrs. Granton as
      guests, and me for the solitary bridesmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your last appearance I hope, Dora, in that capacity,&rdquo; laughed the dear
      old lady. &ldquo;'Thrice a bridesmaid, ne'er a bride,' which couldn't be thought
      of, you know. No need to speak&mdash;I guess why your wedding isn't talked
      about yet.&mdash;The old story, man's pride, and woman's patience. Never
      mind. Nobody knows anything but me, and I shall keep a quiet tongue in the
      matter. Least said is soonest mended. All will come right soon, when the
      Doctor is a little better off in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I let her suppose so. It is of little moment what she or anybody thinks,
      so that it is nothing ill of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrice a bridesmaid, never a bride.&rdquo; Even so. Yet, would I change lots
      with our bride Penelope, or any other bride? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that my mind has settled to its usual level; has had time to view
      things calmly, to satisfy itself that nothing could have been done
      different from what has been done; I may, at last, be able to detail these
      events. For both Max's sake and my own, it seems best to do it, unless I
      could make up my mind to destroy my whole journal. An unfinished record is
      worse than none. During our lifetimes we shall both preserve our secret;
      but many a chance brings dark things to light; and I have my Max's honour
      to guard, as well as my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, papa being out driving, and Penelope gone to town to seek
      for a maid, whom the Governor's lady will require to take out with her&mdash;they
      sail a month hence&mdash;I shall seize the opportunity to write down what
      has befallen Max and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own poor Max! But my lips are on his ring; this hand is as safely kept
      for him as when he first held it in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me turn back a page, and see where it was I left off writing my
      journal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so; and it was more than I could bear at the time. I have had to
      take another day for this relation, and even now it is bitter enough to
      recall the feelings with which I put my pen by, so long ago, waiting for
      Max to come in &ldquo;at any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited ten days; not unhappily, though the last two were somewhat
      anxious, but it was simply lest anything might have gone wrong with him or
      his affairs. As for his neglecting or &ldquo;treating me ill,&rdquo; as Penelope
      suggested, such a thought never entered my head. How could he treat me
      ill?&mdash;he loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenth day, which was the end of the term he had named for his journey,
      I of course fully expected him.' I knew if by any human power it could be
      managed, I should see him; he never would break his word. I rested on his
      love as surely as in waking from that long sick swoon I had rested on his
      breast. I knew he would be tender over me, and not let me suffer one more
      hour's suspense or pain that he could possibly avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may here seem strange that I had never asked Max where he was going,
      nor anything of the business he was going upon. Well, that was his secret,
      the last secret that was ever to be between us; so I chose not to
      interfere with it, but to wait his time. Also, I did not fret much about
      it, whatever it was. He loved me. People who have been hungry for love,
      and never had it all their lives, can understand the utterly satisfied
      contentment of this one feeling&mdash;Max loved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk, after staying in all day, I went out, partly because Penelope
      wished it, and partly for health's sake. I never lost a chance of getting
      strong now. My sister and I walked along silently, each thinking of her
      own affairs, when, at a turn in the road which led, not from the camp, but
      from the moorlands, she cried out, &ldquo;I do believe there is Doctor
      Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he had not heard his name, I think he would have passed us without
      knowing us. And the face that met mine, when he looked up&mdash;I never
      shall forget it to my dying day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made me shrink back for a minute, and then I said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Max, have you been ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. Yes&mdash;possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget&mdash;oh! four days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you coming to Rockmount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rockmount?&mdash;oh! no.&rdquo; He shuddered, and dropped my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart seems in a very uncertain frame of mind,&rdquo; said Penelope,
      severely, from the other side the road. &ldquo;We had better leave him. Come,
      Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She carried me off, almost forcibly. She was exceedingly displeased. Four
      days, and never to have come or written! She said it was slighting me and
      insulting the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man, too, of whose antecedents and connections we knew nothing. He may
      be a mere adventurer&mdash;a penniless Scotch adventurer; Francis always
      said he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis is&mdash;&rdquo; But I could not stay to speak of him, or to reply to
      Penelope's bitter words. All I thought was how to get back to Max, and
      entreat him to tell me what had happened. He would tell <i>me</i>. He
      loved <i>me</i>. So, without any feeling of &ldquo;proper pride,&rdquo; as Penelope
      called it, I writhed myself out of her grasp, ran hack to Doctor Urquhart,
      and took possession of his arm, my arm, which I had a right to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Theodora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is I.&rdquo; And then I said, I wanted him to go home with me, and tell
      me what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not; better go home with your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather stay here. I mean to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, took both my hands, and forced a smile:&mdash;&ldquo;You are the
      determined little lady you always were; but you do not know what you are
      saying. You had better go and leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sure then some great misery was approaching us. I tried to read it
      in his face. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;&rdquo; did he still love me; I was about to ask, but
      there was no need. So my answer, too, was brief and plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will leave you as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I ran back to Penelope, and told her I should walk home with Doctor
      Urquhart; he had something to say to me. She tried anger and authority.
      Both failed. If we had been summer lovers it might have been different,
      but now in his trouble I seemed to feel Max's right to me and my love, as
      I had never done before. Penelope might have lectured for everlasting, and
      I should only have listened, and then gone back to Max's side. As I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arm pressed mine close; he did not say a second time, &ldquo;Leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Max, I want to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there is something, and we shall never be quite happy till it is
      told. Say it outright; whatever it is, I shall not mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it something very terrible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that might come between and part us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I trembled, though not much, having so strong a belief in the
      impossibility of parting. Yet there must have been an expression I hardly
      intended in the cry &ldquo;Oh, Max, tell me,&rdquo; for he again stopped suddenly, and
      seemed to forget himself in looking at and thinking of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Theodora,&mdash;you have something to tell <i>me</i> first. Are you
      better? Have you been growing stronger daily? You are sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. Now&mdash;tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak once or twice, vainly. At last he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I wrote you a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I did not mean you should until my death. But my mind has changed.
      You shall have it now. I have carried it about with me, on the chance of
      meeting you, these four days. I wanted to give it to you&mdash;and&mdash;to
      look at you. Oh, my child, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little while, he gave me the letter, begging me not to open it
      till I was alone at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it should shock you&mdash;break your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will break my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, it is too pure and good. God will not suffer it to be
      broken. Now, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For we had reached the gate of Bock-mount. It had never struck me before
      that I had to bid him adieu here, that he did not mean to go in with me to
      dinner; and when he refused, I felt it very much. His only answer was, for
      the second time, &ldquo;that I did not know what I was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now nearly dark, and so misty that I could hardly breathe. Doctor
      Urquhart insisted on my going in immediately, tied my veil close under my
      chin, and then hastily untied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has told me afterwards, he forgot then for the time being, every
      circumstance that was likely to part us; everything in the whole world but
      me. And I trust I was not the only one who felt that it is those alone
      who? loving as we did, are everything to one another who have most
      strength to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came indoors, the first person I met was papa, looking quite bright
      and pleased; and his first question was:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Doctor Urquhart? Penelope said Doctor Urquhart was coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hardly know what was done during that evening, or whether they blamed
      Max or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      All my care was how best to keep his secret, and literally to obey him
      concerning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I never named his letter, nor made any attempt to read it till
      I had bidden good night to them all, and smiled at Penelope's grumbling
      over my long candles and my large fire, &ldquo;as if I meant to sit up all
      night.&rdquo; Yes, I had taken all these precautions in a quiet, solemn kind of
      way, for I did not know what was before me, and I must not fall ill if I
      could help. I was Max's own personal property.
    </p>
    <p>
      How cross she was that night, poor Penelope! It was the last time she has
      ever scolded me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some things, Penelope has felt this more than anyone could, except
      papa, for she is the only one of us who has a clear recollection of Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, his name is written, and I can tell it&mdash;the awful secret I
      learned from Max's letter, which no one except me must ever read.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Max killed Harry. Not intentionally&mdash;when he was out of himself
      and hardly accountable for what he did; in a passion of boyish fury,
      roused by great cruelty and wrong; but&mdash;he killed him. My brother's
      death, which we believed to be accidental, was by Max's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write this down calmly, now; but it was awful at the time. I think I
      must have read on mechanically, expecting something sad, and about Harry
      likewise; I soon guessed that bad man at Salisbury must have been poor
      Harry&mdash;but I never guessed anything near the truth till I came to the
      words &ldquo;I <i>murdered</i> him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To suppose one feels a great blow acutely at the instant is a mistake&mdash;it
      stuns rather than wounds. Especially when it comes in a letter, read in
      quiet and alone, as I read Max's letter that night. And&mdash;as I
      remember afterwards seeing in some book, and thinking how true it was&mdash;it
      is strange how soon a great misery grows familiar. Waking up from the
      first few minutes of total bewilderment, I seemed to have been aware all
      these twenty years that my Max killed Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      O Harry, my brother, whom I never knew&mdash;no more than any stranger in
      the street, and the faint memory of whom was mixed with an indefinite
      something of wickedness, anguish, and disgrace to us all, if I felt not as
      I ought, then or afterwards, forgive me. If, though your sister, I thought
      less of you dead than of my living Max&mdash;my poor, poor Max, who had
      borne this awful burthen for twenty years&mdash;Harry, forgive me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I knew it&mdash;as an absolute fact and certainty&mdash;though as
      one often feels with great personal misfortunes, at first I could not
      realize it. Gradually I became fully conscious what an overwhelming horror
      it was, and what a fearful retributive justice had fallen upon papa and us
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there were some things I had not myself known till this spring, when
      Penelope, in the fullness of her heart at leaving us, talked to me a good
      deal of old childish days, and especially about Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a spoiled child. His father never said him nay in anything&mdash;never,
      from the time when he sat at table, in his own ornamental chair, and drank
      champagne out of his own particular glass, lisping toasts that were the
      great amusement of everybody. He never knew what contradiction was, till,
      at nineteen, he fell in love, and wanted to get married, and would have
      succeeded, for they eloped, (as I believe papa and Harry's mother had
      done), but papa prevented them in time. The girl, some village lass, but
      she might have had a heart nevertheless, broke it, and died. Then Harry
      went all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope remembers, how, at times, a shabby, dissipated man used to meet
      us children out walking, and kiss us and the nurserymaids all round,
      saying he was our brother Harry. Also, how he used to lie in wait for papa
      coming out of church, follow him into his library, where, after fearful
      scenes of quarrelling, Harry would go away jauntily, laughing to us, and
      bowing to mamma, who always showed him out and shut the door upon him with
      a face as white as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister also remembers papa's being suddenly called away from home for a
      day or two, and, on his return, our being all put into mourning, and told
      that it was for brother Harry, whom we must never speak of any more. And
      once, when she was saying her geography lesson, and wanted to go and ask
      papa some questions about Stonehenge and Salisbury, mamma stopped her,
      saying she must take care never to mention these places to papa, for that
      poor Harry&mdash;she called him so now&mdash;had died miserably by an
      accident, and been buried at Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      She died the same year, and soon afterwards we came to Rockmount, living
      handsomely upon grandfather's money, and proud that we had already begun
      to call ourselves Johnston. Oh, me, what wicked falsehoods poor Harry told
      about his &ldquo;family.&rdquo; Him we never again named; not one of our neighbours
      here ever knew that we had a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first shock over, hour after hour of that long night I sat, trying by
      any means to recall him to mind, my father's son, my own flesh and blood&mdash;at
      least by the half-blood&mdash;to pity him, to feel as I ought concerning
      his death, and the one who caused it. But do as I would, my thoughts went
      back to Max&mdash;as they might have done, even had he not been my own Max&mdash;out
      of deep compassion for one who, not being a premeditated and hardened
      criminal, had suffered for twenty years the penalty of this single crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such, I knew. I did not attempt to palliate it, or justify him.
      Though poor Harry was worthless, and Max is&mdash;what he is&mdash;that
      did not alter the question. I believe, even then, I did not disguise from
      myself the truth&mdash;that my Max had committed, not a fault, but an
      actual crime. But I called him my Max still. It was the only word that
      saved me, or I might, as he feared, have &ldquo;broken my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole history of that dreadful night, there is no need I should tell
      to any human being; even Max himself will never know it. God knows it, and
      that is enough. By my own strength, I never should have kept my life or
      reason till the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was necessary, and it was better far that I should have gone
      through this anguish alone, guided by no outer influence, and sustained
      only by that Strength which always comes in seasons like these.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seem, while stretched on the rack of those long night hours, to have
      been led by some supernatural instinct into the utmost depths of human and
      divine justice, human and divine love, in search of <i>the right</i>. At
      last I saw it, clung to it, and have found it my rock of hope ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the house below began to stir, I put out my candle, and stood
      watching the dawn creep over the grey moorlands, just as on the morning
      when we had sat up all night with my father&mdash;Max and I. How fond my
      father was of him&mdash;my poor, poor father!
    </p>
    <p>
      The horrible conflict and confusion of mind came back. I felt as if right
      and wrong were inextricably mixed together, laying me under a sort of
      moral paralysis, out of which the only escape was madness. Then out of the
      deeps I cried unto Thee: O Thou whose infinite justice includes also
      infinite forgiveness; and Thou heardest me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath
      committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his
      soul alive?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered these words: and unto Thee I trusted my Max's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was daylight now, and the little birds began waking up, one by one,
      until they broke into a perfect chorus of chirping and singing. I thought,
      was ever grief like this of mine? Yes&mdash;one grief would have been
      worse&mdash;if, this sunny summer morning, I knew he had ceased to love
      me, and I to believe in him&mdash;if I had lost him&mdash;never either in
      this world or the next, to find him more.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little, I thought if I could only go to sleep, though but for half
      an hour&mdash;it would be well. So I undressed and laid myself down, with
      Max's letter tight hidden in my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep came; but it ended in dreadful dreams, out of which I awoke,
      screaming, to see Penelope standing by my bedside, with my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I had already laid my plans&mdash;to tell my father all. For he must
      be told. No other alternative presented itself to me as possible&mdash;nor,
      I knew, would it to Max. When two people are thoroughly one, each guesses
      instinctively the other's mind; in most things always in all great things,
      for one faith and love includes also one sense of right. I was as sure as
      I was of my existence that Max meant my father to be told. Not even to
      make me happy would he have deceived me&mdash;and not even that we might
      be married, would he consent that we should deceive my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, that my father must be told, and that I must tell him, was a matter
      settled and clear&mdash;but I never considered about how far must be
      explained to anyone else, till I saw Penelope stand there with her
      familiar household face, half cross, half alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, child, what on earth is the matter? Here are you, staring as if you
      were out of your senses&mdash;and there is Doctor Urquhart, who has been
      haunting the place like a ghost ever since daylight. I declare, I'll send
      for him and give him a piece of my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, don't,&rdquo; I gasped, and all the horror returned&mdash;vivid as
      daylight makes any new anguish. Penelope soothed me&mdash;with the
      motherliness that had come over since I was ill, and the gentleness that
      had grown up in her since she had been happy, and Francis loving. My
      miserable heart yearned to her, a woman like myself&mdash;a good woman,
      too, though I did not appreciate her once, when I was young and foolish,
      and had never known care, as she had. How it came out I cannot tell&mdash;I
      have never regretted it&mdash;nor did Max, for I think it saved my heart
      from breaking&mdash;but I then and there told my sister Penelope our
      dreadful story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see her still, sitting on the bed, listening with blanched face, gazing,
      not at me, but at the opposite wall. She made no outcry of grief, or
      horror against Max. She took all in a subdued, quiet way, which I had not
      expected would have been Penelope's passion of bearing a great grief. She
      hardly said anything, till I cried with a bitter cry:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I want Max. Let me rise and go down, for I must see Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we two women looked at one another pitifully, and my sister, my happy
      sister who was to be married in a fortnight, took me in her arms, sobbing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dora, my poor, poor child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this seems years upon years ago, and I can relate it calmly enough,
      till I call to mind that sob of Penelope's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what happened next? I remember, Penelope came in when I was
      dressing, and told me, in her ordinary manner, that papa wished her to
      drive with him to the Cedars this morning. &ldquo;Shall I go, Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will see <i>him</i> in our absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, then came back and kissed me. I suppose she thought this
      meeting between Max and me would be an eternal farewell. The carriage had
      scarcely driven off, when I received a message that Doctor Urquhart was in
      the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry&mdash;Harry, twenty years dead&mdash;my own brother killed by my
      husband! Let me acknowledge. Had I known this <i>before</i> he was my
      betrothed husband, chosen open-eyed, with all my judgment, my conscience,
      and my soul, loved, not merely because he loved me, but because I loved
      him, honoured him, and trusted him, so that even marriage could scarcely
      make us more entirely one than we were already&mdash;had I been aware of
      this before, I might not, indeed I think I never should have loved him.
      Nature would have instinctively prevented me. But now it was too late. I
      loved him, and I could not unlove him: Nature herself forbade the
      sacrifice. It would have been like tearing my heart out of my bosom; he
      was half myself&mdash;and maimed of him, I should never have been my right
      self afterwards. Nor would he. Two living lives to be blasted for one that
      was taken unwittingly twenty years ago! Could it&mdash;ought it so to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the world are free to be their own judges in the matter; but
      God and my conscience are mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went downstairs steadfastly, with my mind all clear. Even to the last
      minute, with my hand on the parlor-door, my heart&mdash;where all throbs
      of happy love seemed to have been long, long forgotten&mdash;my still
      heart prayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max was standing by the fire&mdash;he turned round. He, and the whole
      sunshiny room swam before my eyes for an instant,&mdash;then I called up
      my strength and touched him. He was trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max, sit down.&rdquo; He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knelt by him. I clasped his hands close, but still he sat as if he had
      been a stone. At last he muttered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see you, just once more, to know how you bore it&mdash;to be
      sure I had not killed you also&mdash;oh, it is horrible, horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said it was horrible&mdash;but that we would be able to bear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot mean <i>that?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I have thought it all over, and I do.&rdquo; Holding me at arm's length,
      his eyes questioned my inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the truth. It is not pity&mdash;not merely pity, Theodora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word&mdash;the first crisis was past&mdash;everything
      which made our misery a divided misery.&mdash;He opened his arms and took
      me once more into my own place&mdash;where alone I ever really rested, or
      wish to rest until I die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max had been very ill, he told me, for days, and now seemed both in body
      and mind as feeble as a child. For me, my childishness or girlishness,
      with its ignorance and weakness, was gone for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought since, that in all women's deepest loves, be they ever so
      full of reverence, there enters sometimes much of the motherly element,
      even as on this day I felt as if I were somehow or other in charge of Max,
      and a great deal older than he. I fetched a glass of water, and made him
      drink it&mdash;bathed his poor temples and wiped them with my handkerchief&mdash;persuaded
      him to lean back quietly and not speak another word for ever so long. But
      more than once, and while his head lay on my shoulder, I thought of his
      mother, my mother who might have been&mdash;and how, though she had left
      him so many years, she must, if she knew of all he had suffered, be glad
      to know there was at last one woman found who would, did Heaven permit,
      watch over him through life, with the double love of both wife and mother,
      and who, in any case, would be faithful to him till death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faithful till death. Yes,&mdash;I here renewed that vow, and had Harry
      himself come and stood before me, I should have done the same. Look you,
      any one who after my death may read this;&mdash;there are two kinds of
      love, one, eager only to get its desire, careless of all risks and costs,
      in defiance almost of Heaven and earth; the other, which in its most
      desperate longing has strength to say, &ldquo;If it be right and for our good&mdash;if
      it be according to the will of God.&rdquo; This only, I think, is the true and
      consecrated love, which therefore is able to be faithful till death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max and I never once spoke about whether or not we should be married&mdash;we
      left all that in Higher hands. We only felt we should always be true to
      one another&mdash;and that, being what we were, and loving as we did, God
      himself could not will that any human will or human justice should put us
      asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being clear, we set ourselves to meet what was before us. I told him
      poor Harry's history, so far as I knew it myself; afterwards we began to
      consider how best the truth could be broken to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here let me confess something, which Max has long forgiven, but which
      I can yet hardly forgive myself. Max said, &ldquo;And when your father is told,
      he shall decide what next is to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he requires atonement, he must have it, even at the hands of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, it struck me that, though Max was safe so long
      as he made no confession, for the peculiar circumstances of Harry's death
      left no other evidence against him, still, this confession once public
      (and it was, for had I not told Penelope?) his reputation, liberty, life
      itself, were in the hands of my sister and my father. A horror as of death
      fell upon me. I clung to him who was my all in this world, dearer to me
      than father, mother, brother, or sister; and I urged that we should both,
      then and there, fly&mdash;escape together anywhere, to the very ends of
      the earth, out of reach of justice and my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have been almost beside myself before I thought of such a thing. I
      hardly knew all it implied, until Max gravely put me from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be you who says this. Not Theodora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, as unconnected and even incongruous things will flash across
      one in times like these, I called to mind the scene in my favourite play,
      when, the alternative being life or honour, the woman says to her lover, &ldquo;<i>No,
      die!</i>&rdquo; Little I dreamed of ever having to say to my Max almost the same
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said them, kneeling by him, and imploring his pardon for having wished
      him to do such a thing even for his safety and my happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not have been happy, child,&rdquo; he said, smoothing my hair, with a
      sad, fond smile. &ldquo;You do not know what it is to have a secret weighing
      like lead upon your soul. Mine feels lighter now than it has done for
      years. Let us decide: what hour to-night shall I come here and tell your
      father?&rdquo; Saying this, Max turned white to the very lips, but still he
      comforted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be afraid, my child. I am not afraid. Nothing can be worse than
      what has been&mdash;to me. I was a coward once, but then I was only a boy,
      hardly able to distinguish right from wrong. Now I see that it would have
      been better to have told the whole truth at once, and taken all the
      punishment. It might not have been death, or if it were, I could but have
      died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max, Max!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; and he closed my lips so that they could not moan. &ldquo;The truth is
      better than life, better even than a good name. When your father knows the
      truth, all else will be clear. I shall abide by his decision, whatever it
      be; he has a right to it. Theodora,&rdquo; his voice faltered, &ldquo;make him
      understand, some day, that if I had married you, he never should have
      wanted a son,&mdash;your poor father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were almost the last words Max said on this, the last hour that we
      were together by ourselves. For minutes and minutes he held me in his
      arms, silently; and I shut my eyes, and felt, as if in a dream, the
      sunshine and the flower-scents, and the loud singing of the two canaries
      in Penelope's greenhouse. Then,-with one kiss, he put me down softly from
      my place, and left me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been alone ever since; God only, knows <i>how</i> alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest I cannot tell to-day.

      CHAPTER II. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his is the last,
      probably, of those &ldquo;letters never sent,&rdquo; which may reach you one day; when
      or how, we know not. All that is, is best.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say you think it advisable that there should be an accurate written
      record of all that passed between your family and myself on the final day
      of parting, in order that no further conduct of mine may be misconstrued
      or misjudged. Be it so. My good name is worth preserving; for it must
      never be any disgrace to you that Max Urquhart loved you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this record is to be minute and literal, perhaps it will be better I
      should give it impersonally, as a statement rather than a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On February 9th, 1857, I went to Rockmount, to see Theodora Johnston, for
      the first time after she was aware that I had, long ago, taken the life of
      her half-brother, Henry Johnston, not intentionally, but in a fit of
      drunken rage. I came, simply to look at her dear face once more, and to
      ask her in what way her father would best bear the shock of this
      confession of mine, before I took the second step of surrendering myself
      to justice, or of making atonement in any other way that Mr. Johnston
      might choose. To him and his family my life was owed, and I left them to
      dispose of it or of me in any manner they thought best.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these intentions, I went to Theodora. I knew her well. I felt sure
      she would pity me, that she would not refuse me her forgiveness, before
      our eternal separation; that though the blood upon my hands was half her
      own, she would not judge me the less justly, or mercifully, or
      Christianly. As to a Christian woman, I came to her&mdash;as I had come
      once before, in a question of conscience; also, as to the woman who had
      been my friend, with all the rights and honours of that name, before she
      became to me anything more and dearer. And I was thankful that the lesser
      tie had been included in the greater, so that both need not be entirely
      swept away and disannulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found not only my friend, upon whom, above all others, I could depend,
      but my own, my love, the woman above all women who was mine; who, loving
      me before this blow fell, clung to me still, and believing that God
      Himself had joined us together suffered nothing to put us asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she made me comprehend this I shall not relate, as it concerns
      ourselves alone. When at last I knelt by her and kissed her blessed hands&mdash;my
      saint! and yet all woman, and all my own&mdash;I felt that my sin was
      covered, that the All-merciful had had mercy upon me. That while, all
      these years, I had followed miserably my own method of atonement, denying
      myself all life's joys, and cloaking myself with every possible ray of
      righteousness I could find, He had suddenly led me by another way, sending
      this child's love, first to comfort and then, to smite me, that, being
      utterly bruised, broken, and humbled, I might be made whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the first time, I felt like a man to whom there is a possibility
      of being made whole. Her father might hunt me to death, the law might lay
      hold on me, the fair reputation under which I had shielded myself might be
      torn and scattered to the winds; but for all that I was safe, I was
      myself, the true Max Urquhart, a grievous sinner; yet no longer unforgiven
      or hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That line struck home. Oh, that I could strike it home to every miserable
      heart as it went to mine. Oh! that I could carry into the utmost corners
      of the earth the message, the gospel which Dallas believed in, the only
      one which has power enough for the redemption of this sorrowful world&mdash;the
      gospel of the forgiveness and remission of sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she talked to me&mdash;this my saint, Theodora&mdash;Dallas himself
      might have spoken, apostle-like, through her lips. She said, when I
      listened in wonder to the clearness of some of her arguments, that she
      hardly knew how they had come into her mind, they seemed to come of
      themselves; but they were there, and she was <i>sure</i> they were true.
      She was sure, she added, reverently, that if the Christ of Nazareth were
      to pass by Rockmount door this day, the only word He would say unto me,
      after all I had done, would be:&mdash;&ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven thee&mdash;rise
      up and walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I did so. I went out of the house an altered man. My burthen of years
      had been lifted off me for ever and ever. I understood something of what
      is meant by being &ldquo;born again.&rdquo; I could dimly guess at what they must have
      felt-who sat at the Divine feet, clothed and in their right mind, or who,
      across the sunny plains of Galilee, leaped, and walked, and ran, praising
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed the moorland, walking erect, with eyes fixed on the blue sky, my
      heart tender and young as a child's. I even stopped, child-like, to pluck
      a stray primrose under a tree in a lane, which had peeped out, as if it
      wished to investigate how soon spring would come. It seemed to me so
      pretty&mdash;I might never have seen a primrose since I was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me relate the entire truth&mdash;she wishes it. Strange as it may
      appear, though hour by hour brought nearer the time when I had fixed to be
      at Rockmount, to confess unto a father that I had been the slayer of his
      only son&mdash;still that day was not an unhappy day. I spent it chiefly
      out of doors on the moorlands, near a way-side public-house, where I had
      lodged some nights, drinking in large draughts of the beauty of this
      external world, and feeling even outer life sweet, though nothing to that
      renewed life which I now should never lose again. Never&mdash;even if I
      had to go next day to prison and trial, and stand before the world a
      convicted homicide. Nay, I believe I could have mounted the scaffold
      amidst those gaping thousands that were once my terror, and die peacefully
      in spite of them, feeling no longer either guilty or afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for myself, which will explain a good deal that followed in the
      interview which I have now to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora had wished to save me by herself, explaining all to her father;
      but I would not allow this, and at length she yielded. However, things
      fell out differently from both our intentions: he learned it first from
      his daughter Penelope. The moment I entered his study I was certain Mr.
      Johnston knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no sinner, however healed, deceive himself that his wound will never
      smart again. He is not instantly made a new man of, whole and sound: he
      must grow gradually, even through many a returning pang, into health and
      cure. If anyone thinks I could stand in the presence of that old man
      without an anguish sharp as death, which made me for the moment wish I had
      never been born, he is mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alleviations came. The first was to see the old man sitting there
      alive and well, though evidently fully aware of the truth, and having been
      so for some time, for his countenance was composed, his tea was placed
      beside him on the table, and there was an open Bible before him, in which
      he had been reading. His voice, too, had nothing unnatural or alarming in
      it, as, without looking at me, he bade the maid-servant &ldquo;give Doctor
      Urquhart a chair and say, if anyone interrupted, that we were particularly
      engaged.&rdquo; So the door was shut upon us, leaving us face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not long before he raised his eyes to him. It is enough, once
      in a lifetime, to have borne such a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Johnston,&rdquo;&mdash;but he shut his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what you have come to tell me I know already. My
      daughter told me this morning. And I have been trying ever since to find
      out what my church says to the shedder of blood; what she would teach a
      father to say to the murderer of his child. My Harry, my only son! And you
      murdered him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let the words which followed be sacred. If in some degree they were
      unjust, and overstepped the truth, let me not dare to murmur. I believe
      the curses he heaped upon me in his own words and those of the Holy Book,
      will not come, for its other and diviner words, which his daughter taught
      me, stand as a shield between me and him. I repeated them to myself in my
      silence, and so I was able to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he paused and commanded me to speak, I answered only a few words,
      namely, that I was here to offer my life for his son's life; that he might
      do with me what he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means, that I should give you up to justice, have you tried,
      condemned, executed. You, Doctor Urquhart, whom the world thinks so well
      of. I might live to see you hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes glared, his whole frame was convulsed. I entreated him to calm
      himself, for his own health's sake, and the sake of his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will. Old as I am, this shall not kill me. I will live to exact
      retribution. My boy, my poor murdered Harry&mdash;murdered&mdash;murdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept repeating and dwelling on the word, till at length I said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know the whole truth, you must be aware that I had no intention to
      murder him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you extenuate? You wish to escape? But you shall not. I will have
      you arrested now, in this very house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the end had come. Life, and all its hopes, all its work, were over for
      me. I saw, as in a second of time, everything that was coming&mdash;the
      trial, the conviction, the newspaper clatter over my name, my ill deeds
      exaggerated, my good deeds pointed at with the finger of scorn, which
      perhaps was the keenest agony of all&mdash;save one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodora!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether I uttered her name, or only thought it, I cannot tell. However, it
      brought her. I felt she was in the room, though she stood by her sister's
      side, and did not approach me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, I repeat, let no man say that sin does not bring its wages, which
      <i>must</i> be paid. Whosoever doubts it, I would he could sit as I sat,
      watching the faces of father and daughters, and thinking of the dead face
      which lay against my knee, that midnight, on Salisbury plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; I heard Mr. Johnston saying, &ldquo;I have sent for you to be my
      witnesses in what I am about to do. Not out of personal revenge&mdash;which
      were unbecoming a clergyman&mdash;but because God and man exact
      retribution for blood. There is the man who murdered Harry. Though he were
      the best friend I ever had, though I esteemed him ever so much, which I
      did,&mdash;still, discovering this, I must have retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, father?&rdquo; Not <i>her</i> voice, but her sister's. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me do full justice to Penelope Johnston. Though it was she who told my
      secret to her father, she did it out of no malice. As I afterwards learnt,
      chance led their conversation into such a channel, that she could only
      escape betraying the truth by a direct lie. And with all her harshnesses,
      the prominent feature of her character is its truthfulness, or rather its
      abhorrence of falsehood. Nay, her fierce scorn of any kind of duplicity is
      such, that she confounds the crime with the criminal, and, once deceived,
      never can forgive,&mdash;as in the matter of Lydia Cartwright, my
      acquaintance with which gave me this insight into Miss Johnston's
      peculiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though it fell to her lot to betray my confession, I doubt not she
      did so with most literal accuracy; acting towards me neither as a friend
      nor foe, but simply as a relater of facts. Nor was there any personal
      enmity towards me in her question to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you say? By the law, I conclude. There is no other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if so, what will be the result? I mean what will be done to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell&mdash;how should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can; for I have thought over and studied the question all day,&rdquo;
       answered Miss Johnston, still in the same cold, clear, impartial voice.
      &ldquo;He will be tried, of course. I find from your 'Taylor on Evidence,'
      father, that a man can be tried and convicted, solely on his own
      confession. But in this case, there being no corroborating proof, and all
      having happened so long ago, it will scarcely prove a capital crime. I
      believe no jury would give a stronger verdict than manslaughter. He will
      be imprisoned, or transported beyond seas; where, with his good character,
      he will soon work his liberty, and start afresh in another country, in
      spite of us. This, I think, is the common-sense view of the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astonished as Mr. Johnston looked, he made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for this, you and we shall have the credit of having had arrested in
      our own house, a man who threw himself on our mercy, who, though he
      concealed, never denied his guilt; who never deceived us in any way. The
      moment he discovered the whole truth, dreadful as it was, he never shirked
      it, nor hid it from us; but told us outright, risking all the
      consequences. A man, too, against whom, in his whole life, we can prove
      but this one crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, do you take his part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I wish he had died before he set foot in this house&mdash;for
      I remember Harry. But I see also that after all this lapse of years Harry
      is not the only person whom we ought to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember nothing but the words of this Book,&rdquo; cried the old man,
      letting his hand drop heavily upon it. &ldquo;'Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by
      man shall his blood be shed.' What have you to say for yourself, <i>murderer?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time, faithful to her promise to me, she had not interfered&mdash;she,
      my love, who loved me; but when she heard him call me <i>that</i>, she
      shivered all over, and looked towards me. A pitiful, entreating look, but,
      thank God, there was no doubt in it&mdash;not the shadow of change. It
      nerved me to reply, what I will here record, by her desire and for her
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Johnston, I have this to say. It is written,&mdash;'Whoso hateth his
      brother is a murderer,' and in that sense, I am one,&mdash;for I did hate
      him at the time; but I never meant to kill him&mdash;and the moment
      afterwards I would have given my life for his. If now, my death could
      restore him to you, alive again, how willingly I would die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die, and face your Maker? an unpardoned man-slayer, a lost soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I live or die,&rdquo; said I, humbly, &ldquo;I trust my soul is not lost. I
      have been very guilty; but I believe in One who brought to every sinner on
      earth the gospel of repentance and remission of sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, burst out the anathema&mdash;not merely of the father, but the
      clergyman,&mdash;who mingled the Jewish doctrine of retributive vengeance
      during this life with the Christian belief of rewards and punishments
      after death, and confounded the Mosaic gehenna with the Calvinistic hell.
      I will not record all this&mdash;it was very terrible; but he only spoke
      as he believed, and as many earnest Christians do believe. I think, in all
      humility, that the Master Himself preached a different gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw it, shining out of her eyes&mdash;my angel of peace and pardon. O
      Thou, from whom all love comes, was it impious if the love of this Thy
      creature towards one so wretched, should come to me like an assurance of
      Thine?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length her father ceased speaking&mdash;took up a pen and began hastily
      writing. Miss Johnston went and looked over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, if that is a warrant you are making-out, better think twice about
      it; for, as a magistrate, you cannot retract. Should you send Dr. Urquhart
      to trial, you must be prepared for the whole truth to come out. He must
      tell it; or, if he calls Dora and me as witnesses&mdash;she having already
      his written confession in full&mdash;<i>we</i> must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The provocation Doctor Urquhart received&mdash;how Harry enticed him, a
      lad of nineteen, to drink&mdash;made him mad, and taunted him. Everything
      will be made public&mdash;how Harry was so degraded that from the hour of
      his death we were thankful to forget that he had ever existed&mdash;how he
      died as he had lived&mdash;a boaster, a coward, spunging upon any one from
      whom he could get money, using his talents only to his shame, devoid of
      one spark of honesty, honour, and generosity. It is shocking to have to
      say this of one's own brother; but, father, you know it is the truth&mdash;and,
      as such, it must be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed&mdash;I listened to her&mdash;this eldest sister, who I knew
      disliked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father seemed equally surprised,&mdash;until, at length, her arguments
      apparently struck him with uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any motive in arguing thus?&rdquo; said he, hurriedly and not without
      agitation; &ldquo;why do you do it, Penelope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, on my own account, though the great scandal and publicity will
      not much affect Francis and me&mdash;we shall soon be out of England. But
      for the family's sake,&mdash;for Harry's sake,&mdash;when all his
      wickednesses and our miseries have been safely covered up these twenty
      years&mdash;consider, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stung him deeper than she knew. I had guessed it before, when I was
      almost a stranger to him&mdash;but now the whole history of that old man's
      life was betrayed in one groan, which burst from the very depth of the
      father's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eli&mdash;the priest of the Lord&mdash;his sons made themselves vile and
      he restrained them not. Therefore they died in one day, both of them. It
      was the will of the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The respectful silence which ensued, no one dared to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke it himself at last, pointing to the door. &ldquo;Go! murderer, or
      man-slayer, or whatever you are, you must go free. Moreover, I must have
      your promise&mdash;no, your oath&mdash;that the secret you have kept so
      long, you will now keep for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said; but he stopped me fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hesitations&mdash;no explanations&mdash;I will have none and give
      none. As you said, your life is mine&mdash;to do with it as I choose.
      Better you should go unpunished, than that I and mine should be disgraced.
      Obey me. Promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in another and still stranger way, my resolutions were broken, my
      fate was decided for me, and I have to keep this secret unconfessed to the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, go. Put half the earth between us if you can&mdash;only go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I turned to obey. Blind obedience seemed the only duty left me. I
      might even have quitted the house, with a feeling of total
      irresponsibility and indifference to all things, had it not been for a low
      cry which I heard, as in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did her father. &ldquo;Dora&mdash;I had forgotten. There was some sort of
      fancy between you and Dora. Daughter, bid him farewell, and let him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she said&mdash;my love said, in her own soft, distinct voice: &ldquo;No,
      papa, I never mean to bid him farewell&mdash;that is, finally&mdash;never
      as long as I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father and sister were both so astounded, that at first they did not
      interrupt her, but let her speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I belonged to Max before all this happened. If it had happened a year
      hence, when I was his wife, it would not have broken our marriage. It
      ought not now. When any two people are to one another what we are, they
      are as good as married; and they have no right to part, no more than man
      and wife have, unless either grows wicked, or both change. I never mean to
      part from Max Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke meekly, standing with hands folded and head drooping; but as
      still and steadfast as a rock. My darling&mdash;my darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Steadfast! She had need to he. What she bore during the next few minutes
      she would not wish me to repeat, I feel sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knows it, and so do I. She knows also that every stab with which I
      then saw her wounded for my sake, is counted in my heart, as a debt to be
      paid one day, if between those who love there can be any debts at all. She
      says not. Yet, if ever she is my wife.&mdash;People talk of dying for a
      woman's sake&mdash;but to live&mdash;live for her with the whole of one's
      being&mdash;to work for her, to sustain and cheer her&mdash;to fill her
      daily existence with tenderness and care&mdash;if ever she is my wife, she
      will find out what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying all he well could say, Mr. Johnston asked her how she dared
      think of me&mdash;me, laden with her brother's blood and her father's
      curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned deadly pale, but never faltered: &ldquo;The curse causeless shall not
      come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;For the blood upon his hand, whether it were Harry's or
      a stranger's, makes no difference; it is washed out. He has repented long
      ago. If God has forgiven him, and helped him to be what he is, and lead
      the life he has led all these years, why should I not forgive him? And if
      I forgive, why not love him?&mdash;and if I love him, why break my
      promise, and refuse to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, then, to marry him?&rdquo; said her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day&mdash;if he wishes it&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this time, I myself hardly remember what passed; I can only see her
      standing there, her sweet face white as death, making no moan, and
      answering nothing to any accusations that were heaped upon her, except
      when she was commanded to give me up, entirely and for ever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, father. I have no right to do it. I belong to him; he is my
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, Miss Johnston said to me&mdash;rather gently than not, for her:
      &ldquo;I think, Doctor Urquhart, you had better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My love looked towards me, and afterwards at her poor father; she too
      said, &ldquo;Yes, Max, go.&rdquo; And then they wanted her to promise she would never
      see me, nor write to me; but she refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I will not marry him for ever so long, if you choose&mdash;but I
      cannot forsake him. I must write to him. I am his very own, and he has
      only me. Oh, papa, think of yourself and my mother.&rdquo; And she sobbed at his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have thought of Harry's mother, not hers, for this exclamation
      only hardened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Theodora rose, and gave me her little hand.&mdash;&ldquo;It can hold firm,
      you will find. You have my promise. But whether or no, it would have been
      all the same. No love is worth having that could not, with or without a
      promise, keep true till death. You may trust me. Now, goodbye. Good-bye,
      my Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that one clasp of the hand, that one look into her fond, faithful
      eyes, we parted. I have never seen her since.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement, which is as accurate as I can make it, except in the case
      of those voluntary omissions which I believe you yourself would have
      desired, I here seal up, to be delivered to you with those other letters
      in case I should die while you are still Theodora Johnston.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also made my will, leaving you all my effects, and appointing you
      my sole executrix; putting you, in short, in exactly the same position as
      if you had been my wife. This is best, in order that by no chance should
      the secret ooze out through any guesses of any person not connected with
      your family; also because I think it is what you would wish yourself. You
      said truly, I have only you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another word, which I do not name in my ordinary letters, lest I might
      grieve you by what may prove to be only a fancy of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, in the hard work of this my life here, I begin to feel that I
      am no longer a young man, and that the reaction after the great strain,
      mental and bodily, of the last few months, has left me not so strong as I
      used to be. Not that I think I am about to die, far from it. I have a good
      constitution, which has worn well yet, and may wear on for some time,
      though not for ever, and I am nearly fifteen years older than you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is very possible that before any change can come, I may leave you,
      never a wife, and yet a widow. Possible, among the numerous fatalities of
      life, that we may never be married&mdash;never even see one another again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, when I see two young people married and happy, taking it all as
      a matter of course, scarcely even recognising it as happiness&mdash;-just
      like Mr. and Mrs. Treherne, who hunted me out lately, and insisted on my
      visiting them&mdash;I think of you and me, and it seems very bitter, and I
      look on the future with less faith than fear. It might not be so if I
      could see you now and then&mdash;but oftentimes this absence feels like
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora, if I should die before we are married, without any chance of
      writing down my last words, take them here.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, they will not come. I can but crush my lips upon this paper&mdash;only
      thy name, not thee, and call thee &ldquo;my love, my love!&rdquo; Remember, I loved
      thee&mdash;all my soul was full of the love of thee. It made life happy,
      earth beautiful, and Heaven nearer. It was with me day and night, in work
      or rest&mdash;as much a part of me as the hand I write with, or the breath
      I draw. I never thought of myself, but of &ldquo;us.&rdquo; I never prayed but I
      prayed for two. Love, my love, so many miles away&mdash;O my God, why not
      grant me a little happiness before I die!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as once I wrote before, and as she says always in all things, <i>Thy
      will be done.</i>

      CHAPTER III. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Friday night.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y Dear Max,
    </p>
    <p>
      You have had your Dominical letter, as you call it, so regularly, that you
      must know all our doings at Rockmount almost as well as ourselves. If I
      write foolishly, and tell you all sorts of trivial things, perhaps some of
      them twice over, it is just because there is nothing else to tell. But,
      trivial or not, I have a feeling that you like to hear it&mdash;you care
      for everything that concerns me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, first, in obedience to orders, I am quite well, even though my
      hand-writing is &ldquo;not so pretty as it used to be.&rdquo; Do not fancy the hand
      shakes, or is nervous or uncertain. Not a bit of it. I am never nervous,
      nor weak either&mdash;now. Sometimes, perhaps, being only a woman after
      all, I feel things a little more keenly than I ought to feel; and then,
      not being good at concealment, at least not with you, this fact peeps out
      in my letters. For the home-life has its cares, and I feel very weary
      sometimes&mdash;and then, I have not you to rest upon&mdash;visibly, that
      is&mdash;though in my heart I do always. But I am quite well, Max, and
      quite content. Do not doubt it. He who has led us through this furnace of
      affliction, will lead us safely to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be glad to hear that papa is every day less and less cold to me&mdash;poor
      papa! Last Sunday, he even walked home from church with me, talking about
      general subjects, like his old self, almost. Penelope has been always good
      and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      You ask if they ever name you? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life at Rockmount moves slowly, even in the midst of marriage
      preparations. Penelope is getting a large store of wedding presents. Mrs.
      Granton brought a beautiful one last night from her son Colin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad you had that long friendly letter from Colin Granton&mdash;glad
      also that, his mother having let out the secret about you and me, he was
      generous enough to tell you himself that other secret, which I never told.
      Well, your guess was right; it was so. But I could not help it; I did not
      know it.&mdash;For me&mdash;how could any girl, feeling as I then did
      towards you, feel anything towards any other man but the merest
      kindliness?&mdash;That is all: we will never say another word about it;
      except that I wish you always to be specially kind to Colin, and to do him
      good whenever you can&mdash;he was very good to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life at Rockmount, as I said, is dull. I rise sometimes, go through the
      day, and go to bed at night, wondering what I have been doing during all
      these hours. And I do not always sleep soundly, though so tired. Perhaps
      it is partly the idea of Penelope's going away so soon; far away, across
      the sea, with no one to love her and take care of her, save Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understand, this is not with any pitying of my sister for what is a
      natural and even a happy lot, which no woman need complain of; but simply
      because Francis is Francis&mdash;accustomed to think only of himself, and
      for himself. It may be different when he is married.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was staying with us here a week; during which I noticed him more
      closely than in his former fly-away visits. When one lives in the house
      with a person&mdash;a dull house too, like ours, how wonderfully odds and
      ends of character &ldquo;crop out,&rdquo; as the geologists say. Do you remember the
      weeks when you were almost continually in our house? Francis had what we
      used then to call 'the Doctor's room.' He was pleasant and agreeable
      enough, when it pleased him to be-so; but, for all that, I used to say to
      myself, twenty times a-day, &ldquo;My dear Max!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This merely implies that by a happy dispensation of Providence, I,
      Theodora Johnston, have not the least desire to appropriate my sister's
      husband, or, indeed, either of my sisters' husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-the-by&mdash;in a letter from Augustus to papa, which reached me
      through Penelope, he names his visit to you; I am glad&mdash;glad he
      should show you such honour and affection, and that they all should see
      it. Do not give up the Trehernes; go there sometimes&mdash;for my sake.
      There is no reason why you should not. Papa knows it; he also knows I
      write to you&mdash;but he never says a word, one way or other. We must
      wait&mdash;wait and hope&mdash;or rather, trust. As you say, the
      difference between young and older people is, the one hopes, the other
      trusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seem, from your description, to have a clear idea of the gaol, and the
      long, barren breezy flat amidst which it lies, with the sea in the
      distance. I often sit and think of the view outside, and of the dreary
      inside, where you spend so many hours; the corridors, the exercise-yards,
      and the cells; also your own two rooms, which you say are almost as silent
      and solitary, except when you come in and find my letter waiting you. I
      wish it was me!&mdash;pardon grammar&mdash;but I wish it was me&mdash;this
      living me. Would you be glad to see me? Ah, I know!
    </p>
    <p>
      Look! I am not going to write about ourselves&mdash;it is not good for us.
      We know it all; we know our hearts are nigh breaking sometimes&mdash;mine
      is. But it shall not. We will live and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was I telling you about?&mdash;oh, Francis. Well, Francis spent a
      whole week at Rockmount, by papa's special desire, that they might discuss
      business arrangements, and that he might see a little more of his intended
      son-in-law than he has done of late years. Business was soon dispatched&mdash;papa
      gives none of us any money during his life-time; what will come to us
      afterwards we have never thought of inquiring. Francis did, though&mdash;which
      somewhat hurt Penelope&mdash;but he accounted for it by his being so
      &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; A relative phrase; why, I should think 500L. a-year, certain, a
      mine of riches&mdash;and all to be spent upon himself. But as he says, a
      single man has so many inevitable expenses, especially when he lives in
      society, and is the nephew of Sir William Treherne, of Treherne Court. All
      &ldquo;circumstances'!&rdquo; Poor Francis; whatever goes wrong he is sure to put
      between himself and blame the shield of &ldquo;circumstances.&rdquo; Now, if I were a
      man, I would fight the world bare-fronted, any how. One would but be
      killed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it wrong of me to write to you so freely about Francis? I hope not. All
      mine are yours, and yours mine; you know their faults and virtues as well
      as I do, and will judge them equally, as we ought to judge those, who,
      whatever they are, are permanently our own. I have tried hard, this time,
      to make a real brother of Francis Charteris; and he is, for many things,
      exceedingly likeable&mdash;nay loveable. I see, sometimes, clearly enough,
      the strange charm which has made Penelope so fond of him all these years.
      Whether, besides loving him, she can trust him&mdash;can look on his face
      and feel that he would not deceive her for the world&mdash;can believe
      every line he writes, and every word he utters, and know that whatever he
      does, he will do simply from his sense of right, no meaner motive
      interfering&mdash;oh, Max, I would give much to be certain Penelope had
      this sort of love for her future husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they have chosen their lot, and must make the best of one another.
      Everybody must, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigho! what a homily I am giving you, instead of this week's history, as
      usual&mdash;from Saturday to Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first few days there really was nothing to tell. Francis and Penelope
      took walks together, paid visits, or sat in the parlour talking&mdash;not
      banishing me, however, as they used to do when they were young. On
      Wednesday, Francis went up to London for the day, and brought back that
      important article, the wedding-ring. He tried it on at supper-time, with a
      diamond keeper, which he said would be just the thing for &ldquo;the governor's
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say wife at once,&rdquo; grumbled I, and complained of the modern fashion of
      slurring over that word, the dearest and sacredest in the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife, then,&rdquo; whispered Francis, holding the ring on my sister's finger,
      and kissing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears started to Penelope's eyes; in her agitation she looked almost like
      a girl again, I thought; so infinitely happy. But Francis, never happy,
      muttered bitterly some regret for the past, some wish that they had been
      married years ago. Why were they not? It was partly his fault, I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after this he left, not to return till he comes to take her away
      finally. In the meanwhile, he will have enough to do, paying his adieux to
      his grand friends, and his bills to his tradespeople, prior to closing his
      bachelor establishment for ever and aye&mdash;how glad he must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed glad, as if with a sense of relief that all was settled, and no
      room left for hesitation. It costs Francis such a world of trouble to make
      up his own mind&mdash;which trouble Penelope will save him for the future.
      He took leave of her with great tenderness, calling her &ldquo;his good,
      faithful girl,&rdquo; and vowing&mdash;which one would think was quite
      unnecessary under the circumstances&mdash;to be faithful to her all the
      days of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when she came into my room, Penelope sat a long time on my bed
      talking; chiefly of old days, when she and Francis were boy and girl
      together&mdash;how handsome he was, and how clever&mdash;till she seemed
      almost to forget the long interval between. Well, they are both of an age&mdash;time
      runs equally with each; she is at least no more altered than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, I ought to tell you something, referring to that which, as we
      agreed, we are best not speaking of, even between ourselves. It is all
      over and done&mdash;cover it over, and let it heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Max, Penelope confessed a thing, for which I am very sorry, but it
      cannot be helped now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you they never name you here. Not usually, but she did that night.
      Just as she was leaving me, she exclaimed, suddenly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, I have broken my promise&mdash;Francis knows about Doctor
      Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be terrified&mdash;not the whole. Merely that he wanted to marry
      you, but that papa found out he had done something wrong in his youth, and
      so forbade you to think of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked her, was she sure no more had escaped her? Not that I feared much;
      Penelope is literally accurate, and scrupulously straight forward in all
      her words and ways. But still, Francis being a little less so than she,
      might have questioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did, and I refused point-blank to tell him, saying it would be a
      breach of trust. He was very angry; jealous, I think,&rdquo; and she smiled,
      &ldquo;till I informed him that it was not my own secret&mdash;all my own
      secrets I had invariably told him, as he me. At which, he said, 'Yes, of
      course,' and the matter ended. Are you annoyed? Do you doubt Francis's
      honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No. For all that, I have felt anxious, and I cannot choose but tell Max;
      partly because he has a right to all my anxieties, and, also, that he may
      guard against any possibility of harm. None is likely to come though; we
      will not be afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus, in his letter, says how highly he hears you spoken of in
      Liverpool already; how your duties at the gaol are the least of your work,
      and that whatever you do, or wherever you go, you leave a good influence
      behind you. These were his very words. I was proud, though I knew it all
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says you are looking thin, as if you were overworked. Max, my Max, take
      care. Give all due energy to the work you have to do, but remember me
      likewise; remember what is mine. I think, perhaps, you take too long walks
      between the town and the gaol, and that maybe, the prisoners themselves
      get far better and more regular meals than the doctor does. See to this,
      if you please, Doctor Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell me more about those poor prisoners, in whom you take so strong an
      interest&mdash;your spiritual as well as medical hospital. And give me a
      clearer notion of your doings in the town, your practice and schemes, your
      gratis patients, dispensaries, and so on. Also, Augustus said you were
      employed in drawing up reports and statistics about reformatories, and on
      the general question now so much discussed,&mdash;What is to be done with
      our criminal classes? How busy you must be! Cannot I help you? Send me
      your MSS. to copy. Give me some work to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, do you remember our talk by the pond-side, when the sun was setting,
      and the hills looked so still, and soft, and blue? I was there the other
      day and thought it all over. Yes, I could have been happy, even in the
      solitary life we both then looked forward to, but it is better to belong
      to you as I do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless you and keep you safe!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. I leave a blank page to fill up after
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope and I come home. We are going into town together early to-morrow,
      to enquire about the character of the lady's maid that is to be taken
      abroad, but we shall be back long before post-time. However, I have
      written all this overnight to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sunday.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. You will have missed your Sunday letter to-day, which vexes me sore.
      But it is the first time you have ever looked for a letter and &ldquo;wanted&rdquo;
       it, and I trust it will be the last. Ah! now I understand a little of what
      Penelope must have felt, looking day after day for Francis's letters,
      which never came; how every morning before post-time she would go about
      the house as blithe as a lark, and afterwards turn cross and disagreeable,
      and her face would settle into the sharp, hard-set expression, which made
      her look so old even then. Poor Penelope! if she could have trusted him
      the while, it might have been otherwise&mdash;men's ways and lives are so
      different from women's&mdash;but it is this love without perfect trust
      which has been the sting of Penelope's existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to remember this when she makes me feel angry with her, as she did
      on Saturday. It was through her fault you missed your Sunday letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know I always post them myself, in the town; our village post-office
      would soon set all the neighbours chattering about you and me. And
      besides, it is pleasant to walk through the quiet lanes we both know well
      with Max's letter in my hand, and think that it will be in his hand
      to-morrow. For this I generally choose the 'time when papa rests before
      dinner, with one or other of us reading to him, and Penelope has hitherto,
      without saying anything, always taken my place and set me free on a
      Saturday. A kindness I felt more than I expressed, many a time. But to-day
      she was unkind; shut herself up in her room the instant we returned from
      town; then papa called me and detained me till after post-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you lost your letter; a small thing, you will say, and this was a
      foolish girl to vex herself so much about it. Especially as she can make
      it longer and more interesting by details of our adventures in town
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not altogether a pleasant day, for something happened about the
      servant which I am sure annoyed Penelope; nay, she being over-tired and
      over-exerted already, this new vexation, whatever it was, made her quite
      ill for the time, though she would not allow it, and when I ventured to
      question, bade me sharply, &ldquo;let her alone.&rdquo; You know Penelope's ways, and
      may have seen them reflected in me sometimes. I am afraid, Max, that,
      however good we may be (of course!) we are not exactly what would be
      termed &ldquo;an amiable family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were amiable when we started, however; my sister and I went up to town
      quite merrily. I am merry sometimes, in spite of all things. You see, to
      have everyone that belongs to one happy and prosperous, is a great element
      in one's personal content. Other people's troubles weigh heavily, because
      we never know exactly how they will bear them, and because, at best, we
      can only sit by and watch them suffer, so little help being possible after
      all. But our own troubles we can always bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will understand all I mean by &ldquo;our own.&rdquo; I am often very, sad for you,
      Max; but never afraid for you, never in doubt about you, not for an
      instant. There is no sting even in my saddest' thought concerning you. I
      trust you, I feel certain that whatever you do, you will do right; that
      all you have to endure will be borne nobly and bravely. Thus, I may grieve
      over your griefs, but never over you. My love of you, like my faith in
      you, is above all grieving. Forgive this long digression; to-day is
      Sunday, the best day in all the week, and my day for thinking most of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return. Penelope and I were both merry, as we started by the very
      earliest train, in the soft May morning; we had so much business to get
      through. <i>You</i> can't understand it, of course, so I omit it, only
      confiding to you our last crowning achievement&mdash;the dress. It is
      white <i>moire antique</i>; Doctor Urquhart has not the slightest idea
      what that is, but no matter; and it has lace flounces, half a yard deep,
      and it is altogether a most splendid affair. But the governor's lady&mdash;I
      beg my own pardon&mdash;the governor's wife, must be magnificent, you
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the mantua-maker, a great West-end personage employed by the grand
      family to whom, by Francis's advice, Lydia Cartwright was sent, some years
      ago, (by-the-by, I met Mrs. Cartwright to-day, who asked after you, and
      sent her duty, and wished you would know that she had heard from Lydia),&mdash;this
      mantua-maker it was who recommended the lady's-maid, Sarah Enfield, who
      had once been a workwoman of her own. We saw the person, who seemed a
      decent young woman, but delicate-looking; said her health was injured with
      the long hours of millinery-work, and that she should have died, she
      thought, if a friend of hers, a kind young woman, had not taken her in and
      helped her. She was lodging with this friend now.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, Sarah Enfield sufficiently pleased us to make my sister
      decide on engaging her, if only Francis could see her first. We sent a
      message to his lodgings, and were considerably surprised to have the
      answer that he was not at home, and had not been for three weeks; indeed,
      he hardly ever was at home. After some annoyance, Penelope resolved to
      make her decision without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly ever at home! What a lively life Francis must lead: I wonder he
      does not grow weary of it. Once, he half owned he was, but added, &ldquo;that he
      must float with the stream&mdash;it was too late now&mdash;he could not
      stop himself.&rdquo; Penelope will, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we drove through the Park, to the address Sarah Enfield had given us&mdash;somewhere
      about Kensington&mdash;Penelope wishing to see the girl once again and
      engage her&mdash;my sister observed, in answer to my remark, that Francis
      must have many invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has. It shows how much he is liked and respected. It will be
      the same abroad. We shall gather round us the very best society in the
      island. Still, he will find it a great change from London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wonder, is she at all afraid of it, or suspects that he once was? that
      he shrank from being thrown altogether upon his wife's society&mdash;like
      the Frenchman who declined marrying a lady he had long visited because
      &ldquo;where should he spend his evenings?&rdquo; O, me! what a heart-breaking thing
      to feel that one's husband needed somewhere to spend his evenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove past Holland Park&mdash;what a bonnie place it is (as you would
      say); how full the trees were of green leaves and birds. I don't know
      where we went next&mdash;I hardly know anything of London, thank goodness!&mdash;but
      it was a pretty, quiet neighbourhood, where we had the greatest difficulty
      in finding the house we wanted, and at last had recourse to the
      post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The post-mistress&mdash;who was rather grim&mdash;&ldquo;knew the place, that
      is, the name of the party as lived there&mdash;which was all she cared to
      know. She called herself Mrs. Chaytor, or Chater, or something like it,&rdquo;
       which we decided must be Sarah Enfield's charitable friend, and
      accordingly drove thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small house, a mere cottage, set in a pleasant little garden,
      through the palings of which I saw, walking about, a young woman with a
      child in her arms. She had on a straw hat with a deep lace fall that hid
      her face, but her figure was very graceful, and she was extremely well
      dressed. Nevertheless, she looked not exactly &ldquo;the lady.&rdquo; Also, hearing
      the gate bell, she called out, &ldquo;Arriet,&rdquo; in no lady's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope glanced at her, and then sharply at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; she began; but stopped&mdash;told me to remain in the
      carriage while she went in, and she would fetch me if she wanted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not. Indeed, she hardly stayed two minutes. I saw the young
      woman run hastily in-doors, leaving her child&mdash;such a pretty boy!
      screaming after his &ldquo;mammy,&rdquo;&mdash;and Penelope came back, her face the
      colour of scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Is it a mistake?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;yes,&rdquo; and she gave the order to drive on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I enquired if anything were the matter, and was answered, &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing
      that I could understand.&rdquo; After which she sat with her veil down,
      cogitating; till, all of a sudden, she sprang up as if some one had given
      her a stab at her heart. I was quite terrified, but she again told me it
      was nothing, and bade me &ldquo;let her alone.&rdquo; Which as you know, is the only
      thing one can do with my sister Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the railway-station we met some people we knew, and she was forced
      to talk;&mdash;so that by the time we reached Rockmount she seemed to have
      got over her annoyance, whatever it was, concerning Sarah Enfield, and was
      herself again. That is, herself in one of those moods when, whether her
      ailment be mental or physical, the sole chance of its passing away is, as
      she says, &ldquo;to leave her alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not say this is not trying&mdash;doubly so now, when, just as she is
      leaving, I seem to understand my sister better and love her more than ever
      I did in my life. But I have learned at last not to break my heart over
      the peculiarities of those I care for; but try to bear with them as they
      must with mine, of which I have no lack, goodness knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a letter to Francis in the post-bag this morning, so I hope she has
      relieved her mind by giving him the explanation which she refused to me.
      It must have been some deception practised on her by this Sarah Enfield,
      and Penelope never forgives the smallest deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was either too much tired or too much annoyed to appear again
      yesterday, so papa and I spent the afternoon and evening alone. But she
      went to church with us, as usual, to-day&mdash;looking pale and tired&mdash;the
      ill mood&mdash;&ldquo;the little black dog on her shoulder,&rdquo; as we used to call
      it, not having quite vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I noticed an absent expression in her eyes, and her voice in the
      responses was less regular than usual. Perhaps she was thinking this would
      almost be her last Sunday of sitting in the old pew, and looking up to
      papa's white hair, and her heart being fuller, her lips were more silent
      than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not mind my writing so much about my sister Penelope? You like me
      to talk to you of what is about me, and uppermost in my thoughts, which is
      herself at present. She has been very good to me, and Max loves everyone
      whom I love, and everyone who loves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall have your letter to-morrow morning. Good night!

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Theodora:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a line extra, written on receipt of yours, which was most welcome.
      I feared something had gone wrong with my little methodical girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not keep strictly to your Dominical letter just now&mdash;write any day
      that you can. Tell me everything that is happening to you&mdash;you must,
      and ought. Nothing must occur to you or yours that I do not know. You are
      mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your last letter I do not answer in detail till the next shall come: not
      exactly from press of business; I would make time if I had it not; but
      from various other reasons, which you shall have by-and-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me, if you remember it, the address of the person with whom Sarah
      Enfield is lodging. I suspect she is a woman of whom, by the desire of her
      nearest relative, I have been in search of for some time. But, should you
      have forgotten, do not trouble your sister about this. I will find out all
      I wish to learn some other way. Never apologise for, or hesitate at,
      writing to me about your family&mdash;all that is yours is mine. Keep your
      heart up about your sister Penelope: she is a good woman, and all that
      befals her will be for her good. Love her, and be patient with her
      continually. All your love for her and the rest takes nothing from what is
      mine, but adds thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me hear soon what is passing at Rockmount. I cannot come to you, and
      help you&mdash;would I could! My love! my love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Urquhart.

    <p>
      There is little or nothing to say of myself this week, and what there was
      you heard yesterday.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y Dear Max:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I write this in the middle of the night; there has been no chance for me
      during the day; nor, indeed, at all&mdash;until now. To-night, for the
      first time, Penelope has fallen asleep. I have taken the opportunity of
      stealing into the next room, to comfort&mdash;and you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Max! Oh, if you knew! oh, if I could but come to you for one
      minute's rest, one minute's love!&mdash;There&mdash;I will not cry any
      more. It is much to be able to write to you; and blessed, infinitely
      blessed to know you are&mdash;what you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, I have been weak, wicked of late; afraid of absence, which tries me
      sore, because I am not strong, and cannot stand up by myself as I used to
      do; afraid of death, which might tear you from me, or me from you, leaving
      the other to go mourning upon earth for ever. Now I feel that absence is
      nothing&mdash;death itself nothing, compared to one loss&mdash;that which
      has befallen my sister, Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have heard of it, even in these few days&mdash;ill news spreads
      fast. Tell me what you hear; for we wish to save my sister as much as we
      can. To our friends generally, I have merely written that, &ldquo;from
      unforeseen differences,&rdquo; the marriage is broken off. Mr. Charteris may
      give what reasons he likes at Treherne Court. We will not try to injure
      him with his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just crept in to look at Penelope; she is asleep still, and has
      never stirred. She looks so old&mdash;like a woman of fifty, almost. No
      wonder. Think&mdash;ten years&mdash;all her youth to be crushed out at
      once. I wonder, will it kill her? It would me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to ask you&mdash;do you think, medically, there is any present
      danger in her state? She lies quiet enough; taking little notice of me or
      anybody&mdash;with her eyes shut during the day-time, and open,
      wide-staring, all night long. What ought I to do with her? There is only
      me, you know. If you fear anything, send me a telegram at once. Do not
      wait to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, that you may the better judge her state, I ought just to give you
      full particulars, beginning where my last letter ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;little black dog on her shoulder,&rdquo; which I spoke of so lightly!&mdash;God
      forgive me! also for leaving her the whole of that Sunday afternoon with
      her door locked, and the room as still as death; yet never once knocking
      to ask, &ldquo;Penelope, how are you?&rdquo; On Sunday night, the curate came to
      supper, and papa sent me to summon her; she came downstairs, took her
      place at table, and conversed. I did not notice her much, except that she
      moved about in a stupid, stunned-like fashion, which caused papa to remark
      more than once, &ldquo;Penelope, I think you are half asleep.&rdquo; She never
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another night, and the half of another day, she must have spent in the
      same manner. And I let her do it without enquiry! Shall I ever forgive
      myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon of Monday, I was sitting at work, busy finishing her
      embroidered marriage handkerchief, alone in the sunshiny parlour, thinking
      of my letter, which you would have received at last; also thinking it was
      rather wicked of my happy sister to sulk for two whole days, because of a
      small disappointment about a servant&mdash;if such it were. I had almost
      determined to shake her out of her ridiculous reserve, by asking boldly
      what was the matter, and giving her a thorough scolding if I dared; when
      the door opened, and in walked Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartily glad to see him, in the hope his coming might set Penelope right
      again, I jumped up and shook hands, cordially. Nor till afterwards did I
      remember how much this seemed to surprise and relieve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, all is right!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I feared, from Penelope's letter, that
      she wa a little annoyed with me. Nothing new that, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something did annoy her, I suspect,&rdquo; and I was about to blurt out as much
      as I knew or guessed of the foolish mystery about Sarah Enfield, but some
      instinct stopped me. &ldquo;You and Penelope had better settle your own
      affairs,&rdquo; said I, laughing. &ldquo;I'll go and fetch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He threw himself down on the velvet arm-chair&mdash;his
      favourite lounge in our house for the last ten years. His handsome profile
      turned up against the light, his fingers lazily tapping the arm of the
      chair, a trick he had from his boyhood,&mdash;this is my last impression
      of Francis&mdash;as <i>our</i> Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to call outside Penelope's door three times, &ldquo;Francis is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis is waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis wants to speak to you,&rdquo; before she answered or appeared; and
      then, without taking the slightest notice of me, she walked slowly
      downstairs, holding by the wall as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I thought, it is Francis who has vexed her after all, and determined
      to leave them to fight it out and make it up again&mdash;this, which would
      be the last of their many lovers' quarrels. Ah! it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards, papa sent for me to the study, and there I saw
      Francis Charteris standing, exactly where you once stood&mdash;you see, I
      am not afraid of remembering 'it myself, or of reminding you. No, my Max!
      Our griefs are nothing, nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope also was present, standing by my father, who said, looking round
      at us with a troubled, bewildered air:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, what is all this? Your sister comes here and tells me she will not
      marry Francis. Francis rushes in after her, and says, I hardly can make
      out what. Children, why do you vex me so? Why cannot you leave an old man
      in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope answered:&mdash;&ldquo;Father, you shall be left in peace, if you will
      only confirm what I have said to that&mdash;that gentleman, and send him
      out of my sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis laughed:&mdash;&ldquo;To be called back again presently. You know you
      will do it, as soon as you have come to your right senses, Penelope. You
      will never disgrace us in the eyes of the world&mdash;set everybody
      gossipping about our affairs, for such a trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My sister made him no answer. There was less even of anger than contempt&mdash;utter,
      measureless contempt-!&mdash;in the way she just lifted up her eyes and
      looked at him&mdash;looked him over from head to heel, and turned again to
      her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, make him understand&mdash;I cannot&mdash;that I wish all this
      ended; I wish never to see his face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said papa, in great perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa and I both turned to Francis, whose careless manner changed a little:
      he grew red and uncomfortable. &ldquo;She may tell if she chooses; I lay no
      embargo of silence upon her. I have made all the explanations possible,
      and if she will not receive them, I cannot help it. The thing is done, and
      cannot be undone. I have begged her pardon, and made all sorts of promises
      for the future&mdash;no man can do more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this sullenly, and yet as if he wished to make friends with her,
      but Penelope seemed scarcely even to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she repeated, still in the same stony voice, &ldquo;I wish you would end
      this scene; it is killing me. Tell him, will you, that I have burnt all
      his letters, every one. Insist on his returning mine. His presents are all
      tied up in a parcel in my room, except this; will you give it back to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took off her ring, a small common turquoise which Francis had given
      her when he was young and poor, and laid it on the table. Francis snatched
      it up, handled it a minute, and then threw it violently into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear witness, Mr. Johnston, and you too, Dora, that it is Penelope, not
      I, who breaks our engagement. I would have fulfilled it honourably&mdash;I
      would have married her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; cried Penelope, with flashing eyes, &ldquo;no&mdash;not that last
      degradation&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have married her,&rdquo; Francis continued, &ldquo;and made her a good
      husband too. Her reason for refusing me is puerile&mdash;perfectly
      puerile. No woman of sense, who knows anything of the world, would urge it
      for a moment. Nor man either, unless he was your favourite&mdash;who I
      believe is at the bottom of this, who, for all you know, may be doing
      exactly as I have done&mdash;Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa started and said hastily, &ldquo;Confine yourself to the subject on hand,
      Francis. Of what is this that my daughter accuses you? Tell me, and let me
      judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis hesitated, and then said, &ldquo;Send away these girls, and you shall
      hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, it flashed upon me <i>what</i> it was. How the intuition came,
      how little things, before unnoticed, seemed to rise and put themselves
      together, including Saturday's story&mdash;and the shudder that ran
      through Penelope from head to foot, when on Sunday morning old Mrs.
      Cartwright curtsied to her at the churchdoor&mdash;all this I cannot
      account for, but I seemed to know as well as if I had been told
      everything. I need not explain, for evidently you know it also, and it is
      so dreadful, so unspeakably dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Max, for the first minute or so, I felt as if the whole world were
      crumbling from under my feet&mdash;as I could trust nobody, believe in
      nobody&mdash;until I remembered you. My dear Max, my own dear Max! Ah,
      wretched Penelope!
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand as she stood, but she twisted it out of mine again. I
      listened mechanically to Francis, as he again began rapidly and eagerly to
      exculpate himself to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may tell you all, if she likes. I have done no worse than hundreds do
      in my position, and under my unfortunate circumstances, and the world
      forgives them, and women too. How could I help it? I was too poor to
      marry. And before I married I meant to do everyone justice&mdash;I meant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope covered her ears. Her face was so ghastly,-that papa himself
      said, &ldquo;I think Francis, explanations are idle. You had better defer them
      and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take you at your word,&rdquo; he replied haughtily. &ldquo;If you or she think
      better of it, or of me, I shall be at any time ready to fulfil my
      engagement&mdash;honourably, as a gentleman should. Good-bye; will you not
      shake hands with me, Penelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked up to her, trying apparently to carry things off with a high
      air, but he was not strong enough, or hardened enough. At sight of my
      sister sitting there, for she had sank down at last, with a face like a
      corpse, only it had not the peace of the dead, Francis trembled. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, if I have done you any harm. It was all the result of
      circumstances. Perhaps, if you had been a little less rigid&mdash;had
      scolded me less and studied me more.&mdash;But you could not help your
      nature, nor I mine. Good-bye, Penelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat, impassive; even when with a sort of involuntary tenderness, he
      seized and kissed her hand; but the instant he was gone&mdash;fairly gone&mdash;with
      the door shut upon him and his horse clattering down the road&mdash;I
      heard it plainly&mdash;Penelope started up with a cry of &ldquo;Francis&mdash;Francis!&rdquo;&mdash;O
      the anguish of it!&mdash;I can hear it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not this Francis she called after&mdash;I was sure of that&mdash;I
      saw it in her eyes. It was the Francis of ten years ago&mdash;the Francis
      she had loved&mdash;now as utterly dead and buried, as if she had seen the
      stone laid over him, and his body left to sleep in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead and buried&mdash;dead and buried. Do you know, I sometimes wish it
      were so; that she had been left, peacefully widowed&mdash;knowing his soul
      was safe with God. I thought, when papa and I&mdash;papa who that night
      kissed me, for the first time since one night you know&mdash;sat by
      Penelope's bed, watching her&mdash;&ldquo;If Francis had only died!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After she was quiet, and I had persuaded papa to go to rest, he sent for
      me and desired me to read a psalm, as I used to do when he was ill&mdash;you
      remember? When it was ended, he asked me, had I any idea what Francis had
      done that Penelope could not pardon?
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, difficult and painful as it was to do it, all I suspected&mdash;indeed,
      felt sure of. For was it not the truth?&mdash;the only answer I could
      give. For the same reason I write of these terrible things to you without
      any false delicacy&mdash;they are the truth, and they must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa lay for some time, thinking deeply. At last he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are no longer a child, and I may speak to you plainly. I am
      an old man, and your mother is dead. I wish she were with us now, she
      might help us: for she was a good woman, Dora. Do you think&mdash;take
      time to consider the question&mdash;that your sister is acting right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, I thought you held that doctrine, 'the greater the sinner the
      greater the saint;' and believed every crime a man can commit may be
      repented, atoned, and pardoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father; but Francis has never either repented or atoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No; and therefore I feel certain my sister is right. Ay, even putting
      aside the other fact, that the discovery of his long years of deception
      must have so withered up her love,&mdash;scorched it at the root, as with
      a stroke of lightning&mdash;that even if she pitied him, she must also
      despise. Fancy, despising one's <i>husband!</i> Besides, she is not the
      only one wronged. Sometimes, even sitting by my sister's bedside, I see
      the vision of that pretty young creature&mdash;she was so pretty and
      innocent when she first came to live at Rockmount,&mdash;with her boy in
      her arms; and my heart feels like to burst with indignation and shame, and
      a kind of shuddering horror at the wickedness of the world&mdash;yet with
      a strange feeling of unutterable pity lying at the depth of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, tell me what you think&mdash;you who are so much the wiser of us two;
      but I think that even if she wished it still, my sister <i>ought not</i>
      to marry Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah me! papa said truly I was no longer a child. I feel hardly even a girl,
      but quite an old woman&mdash;familiar with all sorts of sad and wicked
      things, as if the freshness and innocence had gone out of life, and were
      nowhere to be found. Except when I turn to-you, and lean my poor sick
      heart against you&mdash;as I do now. Max, comfort me!
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, I know, write immediately you receive this. If you could have
      come&mdash;-but that is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus you will probably see, if you have not done so already&mdash;for
      he already looks upon you as the friend of the family, though in no other
      light as yet; which is best. Papa wrote to Sir William, I believe; he said
      he considered some explanation a duty, on his daughter's account; further
      than this, he wishes the matter kept quiet. Not to disgrace Francis, I
      thought; but papa told me one-half the world would hardly consider it any
      disgrace at all. Can this be so? Is it indeed such a wicked, wicked world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Here my letter was stopped by hearing a sort of cry in Penelope's
      room. I ran in, and found her sitting up in her bed, her eyes starting,
      and every limb convulsed. Seeing me, she cried out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a light;&mdash;I was dreaming. But it's not true. Where is
      Francis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply, and she slowly sank down in her bed again. Recollection
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have gone to sleep. Why did you let me? Or why cannot you
      put me to sleep for ever and ever, and ever and ever,&rdquo; repeating the word
      many times. &ldquo;Dora!&rdquo; and my sister fixed her piteous eyes on my face, &ldquo;I
      should be so glad to die. Why won't you kill me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, you will understand the total helplessness one feels in the presence
      of an irremediable grief like this: how consolation seems cruel, and
      reasoning vain. &ldquo;Miserable comforters are ye all,&rdquo; said Job to his three
      friends; and a miserable comforter I felt to this my sister, whom it had
      pleased the Almighty to smite so sore, until I remembered that He who
      smites can heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay down outside the bed, put my arm over her, and remained thus for a
      long time, not saying a single word&mdash;that is, not with my lips. And
      since our weakness is often our best strength, and when we wholly
      relinquish a thing, it is given back to us many a time in double measure,
      so, possibly, those helpless tears of mine did Penelope more good than the
      wisest of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay watching me&mdash;saying more than once:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you cared so much for me, Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It then came into my mind, that as wrecked people cling to the smallest
      spar, if, instead of her conviction that in losing Francis she had lost
      her all, I could by any means make Penelope feel that there were others to
      cling to, others who loved her dearly, and whom she ought to try and live
      for still&mdash;it might save her. So, acting on the impulse, I told my
      sister how good I thought her, and how wicked I myself had been for not
      long since discovering her goodness. How, when at last I learned to
      appreciate her, and to understand what a sorely-tried life hers had been,
      there came not only respect, but love. Thorough sisterly love; such as
      people do not necessarily feel even for their own flesh and blood, but
      never, I doubt, except to them. (Save, that in some inexplicable way,
      fondly reflevted, I have something of the same sort of love for your
      brother Dallas.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, she lying still and listening, I tried to make my sister
      understand what I had myself felt when she came to my bedside and
      comforted me that morning, months ago, when I was so wretched; how no
      wretchedness of loss can be altogether unendurable, so long as it does not
      strike at the household peace, but leaves the sufferer a little love to
      rest upon at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at length I persuaded her to promise that, since it made both papa and
      me so very miserable to see her thus,&mdash;and papa was an old man too.
      we must not have him with us many years&mdash;she would, for our sakes,
      try to rouse herself, and see if life were not tolerable for a little
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, closing her heavy eyes, and folding her hands in a
      pitiful kind of patience, very strange in our quick, irritable Penelope.
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;just a little longer. Still, I think I shall soon die. I
      believe it will kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not contradict her, but I called to mind your words, that, Penelope,
      being a good woman, all would happen to her for good. Also, it is usually
      not the good people who are killed by grief: while others take it as God's
      vengeance, or as the work of blind chance, they receive it humbly as God's
      chastisement, live on, and endure. I do not think my sister will die&mdash;whatever
      she may think or-desire just now. Besides, we have only to deal with the
      present, for how can we look forward a single day? How little we expected
      all this only a week ago?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems strange that Francis could have deceived us for so long; years,
      it must have been; but we have lived so retired, and were such a simple
      family for many things. How far Penelope thinks we know&mdash;papa and I&mdash;I
      cannot guess: she is totally silent on the subject of Francis. Except in
      that one outcry, when she was still only half awake, she has never
      mentioned his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing more I wanted to tell you, Max; you know I tell you
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was leaving my sister, she, noticing I was not undressed, asked
      me if I had been sitting up all night, and reproached me for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;I was not weary; that I had been quietly occupying myself in the
      next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you doing?&rdquo; with sharp suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered without disguise:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was writing to Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max who?&mdash;Oh, I had forgotten his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned from me, and lay with her face to the wall, then said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not. You will live to repent it. Child, mark my words.
      There may be good women&mdash;one or two, perhaps&mdash;but there is not a
      single good man in the whole world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart rose to my lips; but deeds speak louder than words. I did not
      attempt to defend you. Besides, no wonder she should think thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she said, &ldquo;Dora, tell Doctor Urquhart he was innocent comparatively;
      and that I say so. He only killed Harry's body, but those who deceive us
      are the death of one's soul. Nay,&rdquo; and by her expression I felt sure it
      was not herself and her own wrongs my sister was thinking of&mdash;&ldquo;there
      are those who destroy both body and soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer; I only covered her up, kissed her and left her; knowing
      that in one sense I did not leave her either forsaken or alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, I must leave you too, Max; being very weary in body, though my
      mind is comforted and refreshed; ay, ever since I began this letter. So
      many of your good words have come back to me while I wrote&mdash;words
      which you have let fall at odd times, long ago, even when we were mere
      acquaintances. You did not think I should remember them? I do, every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great blow, no doubt. The hand of Providence has been heavy upon
      us and our house, lately. But I think we shall be able to bear it. One
      always has courage to bear a sorrow which shows its naked face, free from
      suspense or concealment; stands visibly in the midst of the home, and has
      to be met and lived down patiently, by every member therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      You once said that we often live to see the reason of affliction; how all
      the events of life hang so wonderfully together, that afterwards we can
      frequently trace the chain of events, and see in humble faith and awe,
      that out of each one has been evolved the other, and that everything, bad
      and good, must necessarily have happened exactly as it did. Thus, I begin
      to see&mdash;you will not be hurt, Max?&mdash;how well it was, on some
      accounts, that we were not married, that I should still be living at home
      with my sister; and that, after all she knows, and she only, of what has
      happened to me this year, she cannot reject any comfort I may be able to
      offer her on the ground that I myself know nothing of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me personally, do not fear; I have <i>you</i>. You once feared that
      a great anguish would break my heart: but it did not. Nothing in this
      world will ever do that&mdash;while I have <i>you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, kiss me&mdash;in thought, I mean&mdash;as friends kiss friends who
      are starting on a long and painful journey, of which they see no end, yet
      are not afraid. Nor am I. Goodbye, my Max.
    </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER VI. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Theodora:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have received my letters regularly; nor am I much surprised that
      they have not been answered. I have heard, from time to time, in other
      ways, all particulars of your sister's illness and of you. Mrs. Granton
      says you keep up well, but I know that, could I see it now, it would be
      the same little pale face which used to come stealing to me from your
      father's bedside, last year.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I ask you to write, my love, believe it is from no doubt of you, or
      jealousy of any of your home-duties; but because I am wearying for a sight
      of your handwriting, and an assurance from yourself that you are not
      failing in health, the only thing in which I have any fear of your
      failing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer a passage in your last, which I have hitherto let be, there was
      so much besides to write to you about&mdash;the passage concerning friends
      parting from friends. At first I interpreted it that in your sadness of
      spirit and hopelessness of the future, you wished me to sink back into my
      old place, and be only your friend. It was then no time to argue the
      point, nor would it have made any difference in my letters, either way;
      but now let me say two words concerning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My child, when a man loves a woman, before he tries to win her, he will
      have, if he loves unselfishly and generously, many a doubt concerning both
      her and himself. In fact, as I once read somewhere, &ldquo;When a man truly
      loves a woman, he would not marry her upon any account, unless he was
      quite certain he was the best person she could possibly marry.&rdquo; But as
      soon as she loves him, and he knows it, and is certain that, however
      unworthy he may be, or however many faults she may possess&mdash;I never
      told you you were an angel, did I, little lady?&mdash;they have cast their
      lot together, chosen one another, as your church says, &ldquo;for better, for
      worse,&rdquo;&mdash;then the face of things is entirely changed. He has his
      rights, close and strong as no other human being can have with regard to
      her&mdash;she has herself given them to him&mdash;and if he has any
      manliness in him he never will let them go, but hold her fast for ever and
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Theodora, I have not the slightest intention of again subsiding
      into your friend. I am your lover and your betrothed husband. I will wait
      for you any number of years, till you have fulfilled all your duties, and
      no earthly rights have power to separate us longer. But in the meantime I
      hold fast to <i>my</i> rights. Everything that lover or future husband can
      be to you, I must be. And when I see you, for I am determined to see you
      at intervals, do not suppose that it will be a friend's kiss&mdash;if
      there be such a thing&mdash;that&mdash;But I have said enough&mdash;it is
      not easy for me to express myself on this wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, this letter is partly to consult you on a matter which is
      somewhat on my mind. With any but you I might hesitate, but I know your
      mind almost as I know my own, and can speak to you, as I hope I always
      shall&mdash;frankly and freely as a husband would to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      About your sister Penelope and her great sorrow I have already written
      fully. Of her ultimate recovery, mentally as well as bodily, I have little
      doubt: she has in her the foundations of all endurance&mdash;a true
      upright nature and a religious mind. The first blow over, a certain little
      girl whom I know will be to her a saving angel; as she has been to others
      I could name. Fear not, therefore&mdash;&ldquo;Fear God, and have no other
      fear:&rdquo; you will bring your sister safe to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, you are aware, Penelope is not the only person who has been
      shipwrecked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should not intrude this side of the subject at present, did I not feel
      it to be in some degree a duty, and one that, from certain information
      that has reached me, will not bear deferring. The more so, because my
      occupation here ties my own hands so much. You and I do not live for
      ourselves, you know&mdash;nor indeed wholly for one another. I want you to
      help me, Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my last, I informed you how the story of Lydia Cartwright came to my
      knowledge, and how, beside her father's coffin, I was entreated by her old
      mother to find her out, and bring her home if possible. I had then no idea
      who the &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; was; but afterwards was led to suspect it might be a
      friend of Mr. Charteris. To assure myself, I one day put some questions to
      him&mdash;point-blank, I believe, for I abhor diplomacy, nor had I any
      suspicion of him personally. In the answer, he gave me a point-blank and
      insulting denial of any knowledge on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the whole truth came out, I was in doubt what to do consistent with
      my promise to the poor girl's mother. Finally, I made inquiries; but heard
      that the Kensington cottage had been sold up, and the inmates removed. I
      then got the address of Sarah Enfield&mdash;that is, I commissioned my old
      friend, Mrs. Ansdell, to get it, and sent it to Mrs. Cartwright, without
      either advice or explanation, except that it was that of a person who knew
      Lydia. Are you aware that Lydia has more than once written to her mother,
      sometimes enclosing money, saying she was well and happy, but nothing
      more?
    </p>
    <p>
      I this morning heard that the old woman, immediately on receiving my
      letter, shut up her cottage, leaving the key with a neighbour, and
      disappeared. But she may come back, and not alone; I hope, most earnestly,
      it will not be alone. And therefore I write, partly to prepare you for
      this chance, that you may contrive to keep your sister from any
      unnecessary pain, and also from another reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not know it,&mdash;and it is a hard thing to have to enlighten my
      innocent love, but your father is quite right; Lydia's story is by no
      means rare, nor is it regarded in the world as we view it. There are very
      few&mdash;especially among the set to which Mr. Charteris belonged&mdash;who
      either profess or practice the Christian doctrine, that our bodies also
      are the temples of the Holy Spirit,&mdash;that a man's life should, be as
      pure as a woman's, otherwise no woman, however she may pity, can, or ought
      to respect him, or to marry him. This, it appears to me, is the Christian
      principle of love and marriage&mdash;the only one by which the one can be
      made sacred, and the other &ldquo;honorable to all.&rdquo; I have tried, invariably,
      in every way to set this forth; nor do I hesitate to write of it to my
      wife that will be&mdash;whom it is my blessing to have united with me in
      every work which my conscience once compelled as atonement and my heart
      now offers in humblest thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this principle, of total purity being essential for both man and
      woman, cannot be too sternly upheld, there is also another side to the
      subject, analagous to one of which you and I have often spoken. You will
      find it in the seventh chapter of Luke and eighth of John: written, I
      conclude, to be not only read, but acted up to by all Christians who
      desire to have in them &ldquo;the mind of Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, my child, you see what I mean-how the saving command, &ldquo;<i>Go and sin
      no more</i>&rdquo; applies to this-sin also.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know much more of what Lydia Cartwright used to be than I do; but it
      takes long for any one error to corrupt the entire character; and her
      remembrance of her mother, as well as her charity to Sarah Enfield, imply
      that there must be much good left in the girl still. She is young. Nor
      have I heard of her ever falling lower than this once. But she may fall;
      since, from what I know of Mr. Charteris's present circumstances, she must
      now, with her child, be left completely destitute. It is not the first
      similar case, by many, that I have had to do with; but my love never can
      have met with the like before. Is she afraid? does she hesitate to hold
      out her pure right hand to a poor creature who never can be an innocent
      girl again; who also, from the over severity of Rockmount, may have been
      let slip a little too readily, and so gone wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do hesitate, say so; it will not be unnatural nor surprising. If
      you do not, this is what I want: being myself so placed that though I feel
      the thing ought to be done, there seems no way of doing it, except through
      you. Should the Cartwrights reappear in the village, persuade your father
      not altogether to set his face against them, or have them expelled the
      neighbourhood. They must leave&mdash;it is essential for your sister that
      they should; but the old woman is very poor. Do not have them driven away
      in such a manner as will place no alternative between sin and starvation.
      Besides, there is the child&mdash;how a man can ever desert his own child!&mdash;but
      I will not enter into that part of the subject. This a strange &ldquo;love&rdquo;
       letter; but I write it without hesitation&mdash;my love will understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will like to hear something of me; but there is little to tell. The
      life of a gaol surgeon is not unlike that of a horse in a mill; and, for
      some things, nearly as hopeless; best fitted, perhaps, for the old and the
      blind. I have to shut my eyes to so much that I cannot remedy, and take
      patiently so much to fight against which would be like knocking down the
      Pyramids of Egypt with one's head as a battering-ram, that sometimes my
      courage fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great prison is, you know, a model of its kind, on the solitary,
      sanitary, and moral improvement system; excellent, no doubt, compared with
      that which preceded it. The prisoners are numerous,-and as soon as many of
      them get out they take the greatest pains to get in again; such are the
      comforts of gaol life contrasted with that outside. Yet they seem to me
      often like a herd of brute beasts, fed and stalled by rule in the manner
      best to preserve their health, and keep them from injuring their
      neighbours; their bodies well looked after, but their souls&mdash;they
      might scarcely have any! They are simply Nos. 1, 2, 3, and so on, with
      nothing of human individuality or responsibility about them. Even their
      faces grow to the same pattern, dull, fat, clean, and stolid. During the
      exercising hour, I sometimes stand and watch them, each pacing his small
      bricked circle, and rarely catch one countenance which has a ray of
      expression or intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good as many of its results are, I have my doubts as to this solitary
      system; but they are expressed on paper in the M.S. you asked for, my kind
      little lady! so I will not repeat them here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it will be a change of thought from your sister's sick-room for you to
      think of me in mine&mdash;not a sick-room though, thank God! This is a
      most healthy region: the sea-wind sweeps round the prison-walls, and
      shakes the roses in the governor's garden till one can hardly believe it
      is so dreary a place inside. Dreary enough sometimes to make one believe
      in that reformer who offered to convert some depraved region into a
      perfect Utopia, provided the males above the age of fourteen were all
      summarily hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you smile, my love, at this compliment to your sex at the expense of
      mine? Yet I see wretches here, whom I cannot hardly believe share the same
      common womanhood as my Theodora. Think over carefully what I asked you
      about Lydia Cartwright; it is seldom suddenly, but step by step, that this
      degradation comes. And at every step there is hope; at least, such is my
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not suppose, from this description, that I am disheartened at my work
      here; besides rules and regulations, there is still much room for personal
      influence, especially in hospital. When a man is sick or dying,
      unconsciously his heart is humanized&mdash;he thinks of God. From this
      simple cause, my calling has a great advantage over all others; and it is
      much to have physical agencies on one's side, as I do not get them in the
      streets and towns. To-day, looking up from a clean, tidy, airy cell, where
      the occupant had at least a chance of learning to read if he chose; and,
      seeing through the window the patch of bright blue sky, fresh and pure as
      ever sky was, I thought of two lines you once repeated to me out of your
      dear head, so full of poetry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;God's in His heaven;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      All's right with the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday I had a holiday. I took the railway to Treherne Court, wishing
      to learn something of Rockmount. You said it was your desire I should
      visit your brother-in-law and sister sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed very happy&mdash;so much as to be quite independent of
      visitors, but they received me warmly, and I gained tidings of you. They
      escorted me back as far as the park-gates, where I left them standing,
      talking and laughing together, a very picture of youth and fortune, and
      handsome looks; a picture suited to the place, with its grand ancestral
      trees branched down to the ground; its green slopes, and its herds of deer
      racing about&mdash;while the turrets of the magnificent house which they
      call &ldquo;home,&rdquo; shone whitely in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see I am taking a leaf out of your book, growing poetical and
      descriptive; but this brief contrast to my daily life made the impression
      particularly strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need have no anxiety for your youngest sister; she looked in excellent
      health and spirits. The late sad events do not seem to have affected her.
      She merely observed, &ldquo;She was glad it was over, she never liked Francis
      much. Penelope must come to Treherne Court for change, and no doubt she
      would soon make a far better marriage.&rdquo; Her husband said, &ldquo;He and his
      father had been both grieved and annoyed&mdash;indeed, Sir. William had
      quite disowned his nephew&mdash;such ungentlemanly conduct was a disgrace
      to the family.&rdquo; And then Treherne spoke about his own happiness&mdash;how
      his father and Lady Augusta perfectly adored his wife, and how the hope
      and pride of the family were-entered in her, with more to the same
      purport. Truly this young couple have their cup brimming over with life
      and its joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, good-bye; which means only &ldquo;God be with thee!&rdquo; nor in any way
      implies &ldquo;farewell.&rdquo;&mdash;Write soon. Your words are, as the Good Book
      expresses it, &ldquo;sweeter than honey and the honey-comb,&rdquo; to me unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should add, though you would almost take it for granted, that in all you
      do concerning Mrs. Cartwright or her daughter, I wish you to do nothing
      without your father's knowledge and consent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nother bright,
      dazzlingly-bright summer morning, on which I begin writing to my dear Max.
      This seems the longest-lasting, loveliest summer I ever knew, outside the
      house. Within, all goes on much in the same way, which you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      My moors are growing all purple, Max; I never remember the heather so rich
      and abundant; I wish you could see it! Sometimes I want you so! If you had
      given me up, or were to do so now, from hopelessness, pride, or any other
      reason, what would become of me! Max, hold me fast. Do not let me go.
    </p>
    <p>
      You never do. I can see how you carry me in your heart continually; and
      how you are for ever considering how you can help me and mine. And if it
      were not become so natural to feel this, so sweet to depend upon you, and
      accept everything from you without even saying &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; I might begin
      to express &ldquo;gratitude;&rdquo; but the word would make you smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I amused you once, I remember, by an indignant disclaimer of obligations
      between such as ourselves; how everything given and received ought to be
      free as air, and how you ought to take me as readily if I were heiress to
      ten thousand a-year, as I would you if you were the Duke of
      Northumberland. No, Max; those are not these sort of things that give me,
      towards you, the feeling of &ldquo;gratitude,&rdquo;&mdash;it is the goodness, the
      thoughtfulness, the tender love and care. I don't mean to insult your sex
      by saying no man ever loved like you; but few men love in that special
      way, which alone could have satisfied a restless, irritable girl like me,
      who finds in you perfect trust and perfect rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not allowed to be grateful on my own account, I may be in behalf of my
      sister Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thus long following out your orders, medical and mental, I begin to
      notice a slight change in Penelope. She no longer lies in bed late, on the
      plea that it shortens the day; nor is she so difficult to persuade in
      going out. Further than the garden she will not stir; but there I get her
      to creep up and down for a little while daily. Lately, she has began to
      notice her flowers, especially a white moss-rose, which she took great
      pride in, and which never flowered until this summer. Yesterday, its first
      bud opened,&mdash;she stopped and examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has been mindful of this&mdash;who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, the gardener and myself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She called John&mdash;showed him what a good bloom it was,
      and consulted how they should manage to get the plant to flower again next
      year. She can then look forward to &ldquo;next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You say, that as &ldquo;while there is life there is hope,&rdquo; with the body; so,
      while one ray of hope is discernible, the soul is alive. To save souls
      alive, that is your special calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems as if you yourself had been led through deep waters of despair,
      in order that you might personally understand how those feel who are
      drowning, and therefore know best how to help them. And lately, you have
      in this way done more than you know of. Shall I tell you? You will not be
      displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max&mdash;hitherto, nobody but me has seen a line of your letters. I could
      not bear it. I am as jealous over them as any old miser; it has vexed me
      even to see a stray hand fingering them, before they reach mine. Yet, this
      week I actually read out loud two pages of one of them to Penelope! This
      was how it came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting by her sofa, supposing her asleep. I had been very miserable
      that morning: tried much in several ways, and I took out your letter to
      comfort me. It told me of so many miseries, to which my own are nothing,
      and among which you live continually; yet are always so patient and tender
      over mine. I said to myself&mdash;&ldquo;how good he is!&rdquo; and two large tears
      came with a great splash upon the paper, before I was aware. Very foolish,
      you know, but I could not help it. And, wiping my eyes, I saw Penelope's
      wide open, watching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Doctor Urquhart been writing any thing to wound you?&rdquo; said she,
      slowly and bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I eagerly disclaimed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is, he ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, were you crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why, indeed? But what could I say except the truth, that they were not
      tears of pain, but because you were so good, and I was so proud of you. I
      forgot what arrows these words must have been into my sister's heart. No
      wonder she spoke as she did, spoke out fiercely and yet with a certain
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora Johnston, you will reap what you sow, and I shall not pity you. Make
      to yourself an idol, and God will strike it down. '<i>Thou shalt have none
      other gods but me.</i>' Remember Who says that, and tremble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I should have trembled, Max, had I <i>not</i> remembered. I said to my
      sister, as gently as I could, &ldquo;that I made no idols; that I knew all your
      faults, and you mine, and we loved one another in spite of them, but we
      did not worship one another&mdash;only God. That if it were His will we
      should part, I believed we could part. And&mdash;&rdquo; here I could not say
      any more for tears. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope looked sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you preaching that doctrine once, child, but&mdash;&rdquo; she
      started up violently&mdash;&ldquo;Can't you give me something to amuse me? Read
      me a bit of that&mdash;that nonsense. Of all amusing things in this world,
      there is nothing like a love-letter. But don't believe them, Dora,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      grasped my hand hard&mdash;&ldquo;they are every one of them lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said that I could not judge, never having received a &ldquo;love-letter&rdquo; in
      all my life, and hoped earnestly I never might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No love-letters? What does he write to you about, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her in a general way. I would not see her half-satirical,
      half-incredulous smile. It did not last very long. Soon, though she turned
      away and shut her eyes, I felt sure she was both listening and thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart cannot have an easy or pleasant life,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but
      he does not deserve it. No man does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or woman either,&rdquo; said I, as gently as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope bade me hold my tongue; preaching was my father's business, not
      mine, that is, if reasoning were of any avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked, did she think it was not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think nothing about nothing. I want to smother thought. Child, can't
      you talk a little? Or stay, read me some of Dr. Urquhart's letters; they
      are not love letters, so you can have no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It went hard, Max, indeed it did! till I considered&mdash;perhaps, to hear
      of people more miserable than herself, more wicked than Francis, might not
      do harm but good to my poor Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I was brave enough to take out my letter and read from it, (with
      reservations now and then, of course), about your daily work and the
      people concerned therein; all that interests me so much, and makes me feel
      happier and prouder than any mere &ldquo;love-letter&rdquo; written to or about
      myself. Penelope was interested too, both in the gaol and the hospital
      matters. They touched that practical, benevolent, energetic half of her,
      which till lately has made her papa's right hand in the parish. I saw her
      large black eyes brightening up, till an unfortunate name, upon which I
      fell unawares, changed all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, I am sure she had heard of Tom Turton. Francis knew him. When I
      stopped with some excuse, she bade me go on, so I was obliged to finish
      the miserable history. She then asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Turton dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and referred to the postscript where you say that both
      yourself and his poor old ruined father hope Tom Turton may yet live to
      amend his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope muttered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never will. Better he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said Doctor Urquhart did not think so. She shook her head impatiently,
      exclaiming she was tired, and wished to hear no more, and so fell into one
      of her long, sullen silences, which sometimes last for hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder whether among the many cruel things she must be thinking about,
      she ever thinks, as I do often, what has become of Francis?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, puzzling over how best to deal with her, I have tried to
      imagine myself in her place, and consider what would have been my own
      feelings towards Francis now. The sharpest and most prominent would be the
      ever-abiding sense of his degradation,&mdash;he who was so dear, united to
      the constant terror of his sinking lower and lower to any depth of crime
      or shame. To think of him as a bad man, a sinner against heaven, would be
      tenfold worse than any sin or cruelty against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, whether or not her love for him has died out, I cannot help
      thinking there must be times when Penelope would give anything for tidings
      of Francis Charteris. I wish you would find out whether he has left
      England, and then perhaps in some way or other I may let Penelope
      understand that he is safe away&mdash;possibly to begin a new and better
      life, in a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new and better life. This phrase&mdash;Penelope might call it our
      &ldquo;cant,&rdquo; yet what we solemnly believe in is surely not cant&mdash;brings me
      to something I have to tell you this week. For some reasons I am glad it
      did not occur until this week, that I might have time for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, if you remember, when you made to me that request about Lydia
      Cartwright, I merely answered &ldquo;that I would endeavour to do as you
      wished;&rdquo; as, indeed, I always would, feeling that my duty to you, even in
      the matter of &ldquo;obedience,&rdquo; has already begun. I mean to obey, you see, but
      would rather do it with my heart, as well as my conscience. So, hardly
      knowing what to say to you, I just said this, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My life has been so still, so safely shut up from the outside world, that
      there are many subjects I have never even thought about, and this was one.
      After the first great shock concerning Francis, I put it aside, hoping to
      forget it. When you revived it, I was at first startled; then I tried to
      ponder it over carefully, so as to come to a right judgment and be enabled
      to act in every way as became not only myself, Theodora Johnston, but&mdash;let
      me not be ashamed to say it&mdash;Theodora, Max Urquhart's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, all became clear to me. My dear Max, I do not hesitate; I am
      not afraid. I have been only waiting opportunity; which at length came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last Sunday I overheard my class&mdash;Penelope's that was, you know&mdash;whispering
      something among themselves, and trying to hide it from me; when I put the
      question direct, the answer was:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Miss, Mrs. Cartwright and Lydia have come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself grow hot as fire&mdash;I do now, in telling you. Only it
      must be borne&mdash;it must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also another thing, which one of the bigger girls let out, with many
      titters, and never a blush,&mdash;they had brought a child with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Max, the horror of shame and repulsion, and then the perfect anguish
      of pity that came over me! These girls of our parish, Lydia was one of
      them; if they had been taught better; if I had tried to teach them,
      instead of all these years studying or dreaming, thinking wholly of myself
      and caring not a straw about my fellow-creatures. Oh, Max&mdash;would that
      my life had been more like yours!
    </p>
    <p>
      It shall be henceforth. Going home through the village, with the sun
      shining on the cottages, of whose inmates I know no more than of the New
      Zealand savages,&mdash;on the group of ragged girls who were growing up at
      our very door, no one knows how, and no one cares&mdash;I made a vow to
      myself. I that have been so blessed&mdash;I that am so happy&mdash;yes,
      Max, happy! I will work with all my strength, while it is day. You will
      help me. And you will never love me the less for anything I feel&mdash;or
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going that very afternoon, to walk direct to Mrs. Cartwright's, when
      I remembered your charge, that nothing should be attempted without my
      father's knowledge an consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the opportunity when he and I were sitting alone together&mdash;Penelope
      gone to bed. He was saying she looked better. He thought she might begin
      visiting in the district soon, if she were properly persuaded. At least
      she might take a stroll round the village. He should ask her to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't papa. Oh, pray don't!&rdquo;&mdash;and then I was obliged to tell him the
      reason why. I had to put it very plainly before he understood&mdash;he
      forgets things now sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving, did you say?&mdash;Mrs. Cartwright, Lydia, and the child?&mdash;What
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he comprehended,&mdash;and, oh, Max, had I been the girl I was a few
      months ago, I should have sunk to the earth with the shame he said I ought
      to feel at even alluding to such things. But I would not stop to consider
      this, or to defend myself; the matter concerned not me, but Lydia. I asked
      papa if he did not remember Lydia?
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to us, Max, when she was only fourteen, though, being well-grown
      and hand some, she looked older;&mdash;a pleasant, willing, affectionate
      creature, only she had &ldquo;no head,&rdquo; or it was half-turned by the admiration
      her beauty gained, not merely among her own class, but all our visitors. I
      remember Francis saying once&mdash;oh, how angry Penelope was about it&mdash;that
      Lydia was so naturally elegant she could be made a lady of in no time, if
      a man liked to take her, educate and marry her. Would he had done it!
      spite of all broken vows to Penelope. I think my sister herself might have
      for given him, if he had only honestly fallen in love with poor Lydia, and
      married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things I tried to recall to papa's mind, but he angrily bade me be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because, if we had taken better care of the girl,
      this might never have happened. When I think of her&mdash;her pleasant
      ways about the house&mdash;how she used to go singing over her work of
      mornings&mdash;poor innocent young thing&mdash;oh, papa! papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora,&rdquo; he said, eyeing me closely; &ldquo;what change has come over you of
      late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, I did not know, unless it was that which must come over people who
      have been very unhappy&mdash;the wish to save other people as much
      unhappiness as they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain yourself. I do not understand.&rdquo; When he did, he said abruptly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop. It was well you waited to consult with me. If your own delicacy
      does not teach you better, I must. My daughter&mdash;the daughter of the
      clergyman of the parish&mdash;cannot possibly be allowed to interfere with
      these profligates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart sunk like lead:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, papa? They are here; you, as the rector, must do something. What
      shall you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall forbid them the church and the sacrament; omit them from my
      charities; and take every lawful means to get them out of the
      neighbourhood. This, for my family's sake, and the parish's&mdash;that
      they may carry their corruption elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they may not be wholly corrupt. And the child&mdash;that innocent,
      unfortunate child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, Dora. It is written, <i>The seed of evil-doers shall never be
      renowned</i>. The sinless must suffer with the guilty; there is no hope
      for either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; I cried, in an agony, &ldquo;Christ did not say so. He said, 'Go,
      and sin no more.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was I wrong? If I was, I suffered for it. What followed was very hard to
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, if ever I am yours, altogether in your power, I wonder, will you ever
      give me those sort of bitter, cruel words? Words which people, living
      under the same roof, think nothing of using&mdash;mean nothing by them&mdash;yet
      they cut sharp, like swords. The flesh closes up after them&mdash;but oh,
      they bleed&mdash;they bleed! Dear Max, reprove me as you will, however
      much, but let it be in love, not in anger or sarcasm. Sometimes people
      drop carelessly, by quiet firesides, and with a good-night kiss following,
      as papa gave to me, words which leave a scar for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, I was just about to write and ask you to find some other plan
      for helping the Cartwrights, since we neither of us would choose to
      persist in one duty at the expense of another&mdash;when papa called me to
      take a walk with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not strange, the way in which good angels seem to take up the thread
      of our dropped hopes and endeavours, and wind them up for us, we see not
      how, till it is all done? Never was I more surprised than when papa,
      stopping to lean on my arm, and catch the warm, pleasant wind that came
      over the moors, said suddenly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, what could possess you to talk to me as you did last night? And
      why, if you had any definite scheme in your head, did you relinquish it so
      easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you forbade it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, even when differing from your father, you consider it right to obey
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;except&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it out, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except in the case of any duty which I felt to be not less sacred than
      the one I owe to my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking on, we passed Mrs. Cartwright's cottage. It was quiet and silent,
      the door open, but the window-shutter half closed, and there was no smoke
      from the chimney. I saw papa turn round and look. At last he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by telling me they were 'starving?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered the direct, entire truth. I was bold, for it was your mind as
      well as my own I was speaking out, and I knew it was right. I pleaded
      chiefly for the child&mdash;it was easiest to think of it, the little
      creature I had seen laughing and crowing in the garden at Kensington. It
      seemed such a dreadful thing for that helpless baby to die of want, or
      live to turn out a reprobate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, papa,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;if that poor little soul had been our own flesh
      and blood&mdash;if you were Francis's father, and this had been your
      grandchild!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my sorrow, I had forgotten for the time a part of poor Harry's story&mdash;the
      beginning of it: you shall know it some day&mdash;it is all past now. But
      papa remembered it. He faltered as he walked&mdash;at last he sat down on
      a tree by the roadside, and said, &ldquo;He must go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet still, either by accident or design, he took the way by the lane where
      is Mrs. Cartwright's cottage. At the gate of it a little ragged urchin was
      poking a rosy face through the bars; and, seeing papa, this small fellow
      gave a shout of delight, tottered out, and caught hold of his coat,
      calling him &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo; He started&mdash;I thought he would have fallen, he
      trembled so: my poor old father.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I lifted the little thing out of his way, I too started. It is
      strange always to see a face you know revived in a child's face&mdash;in
      this instance it was shocking&mdash;pitiful. My first thought was, we
      never must let Penelope come past this way. I was carrying the boy off&mdash;I
      well knew where, when papa called me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop. Not alone&mdash;not without your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was but a few steps, and we stood on the door-sill of Mrs. Cartwright's
      cottage. The old woman snatched up the child, and I heard her whisper
      something about &ldquo;Run&mdash;Lyddy&mdash;run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lydia, if that white, thin creature, huddled up in the corner were
      she, never attempted to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa walked up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young woman, are you Lydia Cartwright, and is this your child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been meddling with him? You'd better not! I say, Franky, what
      have they been doing to mother's Franky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught at him, and hugged him close, as mothers do. And when the boy,
      evidently both attracted and puzzled by papa's height and gentlemanly
      clothes, tried to get back to him, and again call him &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; she said
      angrily, &ldquo;No, no, 'tis not your daddy. They're no friends o' yours. I wish
      they were out of the place, Franky, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish us away. No wonder. Are you not ashamed to look us in the face&mdash;my
      daughter and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But papa might have said ever so much more, without her heeding. The child
      having settled himself on her lap, playing with the ragged counterpane
      that wrapped her instead of a shawl, Lydia seemed to care for nothing. She
      lay back with her eyes shut, still and white. We may be sure of one thing&mdash;she
      has preferred to starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunnot be too hard upon her, sir,&rdquo; begged the old woman. &ldquo;Dunnot please,
      Miss Dora. She bean't a lady like you, and he were such a fine coaxing
      young gentleman. It's he that's most to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father said sternly, &ldquo;Has she left him, or been deserted by him&mdash;I
      mean Mr. Francis Charteris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; screamed Lydia, &ldquo;what's that? What have they come for? Do they
      know anything about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>She</i> did not, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, my lass,&rdquo; said the mother, soothingly, but it was of no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dora,&rdquo; cried the girl, creeping to me, and speaking in the same sort
      of childish pitiful tone in which she used to come and beg Lisabel and me
      to intercede for her when she had annoyed Penelope, &ldquo;do, Miss Dora, tell
      me. I don't want to see him, I only want to hear. I've heard nothing since
      he sent me a letter from prison, saying I was to take my things and the
      baby's and go. I don't know what's become of him, no more than the dead.
      And, miss, he's that boy's father&mdash;miss&mdash;please&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to go down to her knees, but fell prone on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, who would have thought, the day before, that this day I should have
      been sitting with Lydia Cartwright's head on my lap, trying to bring her
      back to this miserable life of hers; that papa would have stood by and
      seen me do it, without a word of blame!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the hunger,&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;You see, she isn't used to it, now;
      he always kept her like a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa turned, and walked out of the cottage. I afterwards found out that he
      had bought the loaf at the baker's shop down the village, and got the
      bottle of wine from his private cupboard in the vestry. He returned with
      both&mdash;one in each pocket&mdash;then, sitting down on a chair, cut the
      bread and poured out the wine, and fed these three himself, with his own
      hands. My dear father!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he draw back when, as she recovered, the first word that came to
      the wretched girl's lips was &ldquo;Francis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, beg them to tell me about him. I'll do him no harm, indeed I
      won't, neither him nor them. Is he married? Or,&rdquo; with a sudden gasp, &ldquo;is
      he dead? I've thought sometimes he must be, or he never would have left
      the child and me. He was always fond of us, wasn't he, Franky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her, to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Charteris was living, but
      what had become of him we could none of us guess. We never saw him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, looking wistfully at me, Lydia seemed suddenly to remember old
      times, to become conscious of what she used to be, and what she was now.
      Also, in a vague sort of way, of how guilty she had been towards her
      mistress and our family. How long, or how deep the feeling was, I cannot
      judge, but she certainly did feel. She hung her head, and tried to draw
      herself away from my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather not trouble you, Miss Dora, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said it was no trouble, she had better lie still till she felt stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that. Not such as me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told her she must know she had done very wrong, but if she was sorry for
      it, I was sorry for her, and we would help her if we could to an honest
      livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, and the child too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked towards papa; he answered distinctly, but sternly:&mdash;&ldquo;Principally
      for the sake of the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia began to sob. She attempted no exculpation&mdash;expressed no
      penitence&mdash;just lay and sobbed, like a child. She is hardly more,
      even yet&mdash;only nineteen, I believe. So we sat&mdash;papa as silent as
      we, resting on his stick, with his eyes fixed on the cottage floor, till
      Lydia turned to me with a sort of fright. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would Miss Johnston say if she knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered, indeed, what my sister would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, Max&mdash;you will hardly credit it, nobody would, if it were an
      incident in a book&mdash;something occurred which, even now, seems hardly
      possible&mdash;as if I must have dreamt it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open cottage door a lady walked right in, looked at us all,
      including the child, who stopped in his munching of bread to stare at her
      with wide-open blue eyes&mdash;Francis's eyes; and that lady was my sister
      Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked in and walked out again, before we had our wits about us
      sufficiently to speak to her, and when I rose and ran after her, she had
      slipped away somehow, so that I could not find her. How she came to take
      this notion into her head, after being for weeks shut up indoors;&mdash;whether
      she discovered that the Cartwrights had returned, and came here in anger,
      or else, prompted by some restless instinct, to have another look at
      Francis's child&mdash;none of us can guess; nor have we ever dared to
      enquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got home, she was lying in her usual place on the sofa, as if she
      wanted us not to notice that she had been out at all. Still, by papa's
      desire, I spoke to her frankly&mdash;told her the circumstances of our
      visit to the two women&mdash;the destitution in which we found them; and
      how they should be got away from the village as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer whatever, but lay absorbed, as it were&mdash;hardly
      moving, except an occasional nervous twitch, all afternoon and evening,
      until I called her in to prayers, which were shorter than usual&mdash;papa
      being very tired. He only read the collect, and repeated the Lord's
      Prayer, in which, among the voices that followed his, I distinguished,
      with surprise, Penelope's. It had a steadiness and sweetness such as I
      never heard before. And when&mdash;the servants being gone&mdash;she went
      up to papa, and kissed him, the change in her manner was something almost
      startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, when shall you want me in the district, again?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am quite ready to go. I have been ill, and it has made me
      unmindful of many things; but I am better now. Papa, I will try and be a
      good daughter to you. I have nobody but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quietly and softly, bending her head upon his grey hairs. He
      kissed and blessed her. She kissed me, too, as she passed, and then went
      away to bed, without any more explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that time&mdash;and it is now three days ago&mdash;Penelope has
      resumed her usual place in the household&mdash;taken up all her old
      duties, and even her old pleasures; for I saw her in her green-house this
      morning. When she called me, in something of the former quick, imperative
      voice, to look at an air-plant that was just coming into flower, I could
      not see it for tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, there is in her a difference. Not her serious, almost
      elderly-looking face, nor her manner, which has lost its sharpness, and is
      so gentle sometimes that when she gives her orders the servants actually
      stare&mdash;but the marvellous composure which is evident in her whole
      demeanour; the bearing of a person who, having gone through that sharp
      agony which either kills or cures, is henceforth settled in mind and
      &ldquo;circumstances,&rdquo; to feel no more any strong emotion, but go through life
      placidly and patiently, without much further change, to the end. The sort
      of woman that nuns are-made of&mdash;or-Sours de la Charité; or Protestant
      lay-sisters, of whom every village has some; and almost every family owns
      at least one. She will, to all appearance, be our one&mdash;our elder
      sister, to be regarded with reverence unspeakable, and be made as happy as
      we possibly can. Max, I am learning to think with hope and without pain,
      of the future of my sister Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more, and this long letter ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, papa and I walking on the moor, met Mrs. Cartwright, and learnt
      full particulars of Lydia. From your direction, her mother found her out,
      in a sort of fever, brought on by want. Of course, everything had been
      taken from the Kensington cottage, for Francis's debts. She was turned out
      with only the clothes she wore. But you know all this already, through
      Mrs. Ansdell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cartwright is sure it was you who sent Mrs. Ansdell to them, and that
      the money they received week, by week, in their worst distress, came from
      you. She said so to papa, while we stood talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For it was just like our doctor, sir&mdash;as is kind to poor and rich&mdash;I'm
      sure he used to look at you, sir, as if he'd do anything in the world for
      you&mdash;as many's the time I've seed him a-sitting by your bedside when
      you was ill. If there ever was a man living as did good to every poor soul
      as came in his way&mdash;it be Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Papa said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the old woman had gone, he asked if I had any plans about Lydia
      Cartwright?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had one, which we must consult about when she is better,&mdash;whether
      she might not, with her good education, be made one of the
      schoolmistresses that you say, go from cell to cell, instructing the
      female prisoners in these model gaols. But I hesitated to start this
      project to papa&mdash;so told him I must think the matter over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are growing quite a thinking woman, Dora; who taught you, who put it
      into your mind to act as you do?&mdash;you, who were such a thoughtless
      girl;&mdash;speak out, I want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him&mdash;naming the name of my dear Max; the first time it has
      ever passed my lips in my father's hearing, since that day. It was
      received in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after, stopping suddenly, papa said to me, &ldquo;Dora, some day, I
      know you will go and marry Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could I say? Deny it, deny Max&mdash;my love, and my husband? or tell
      my father what was not true? Either was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we walked on, avoiding conversation until we came to our own
      churchyard, where we went in and sat in the porch, sheltering from the
      noon-heat, which papa feels more than he used to do. When he took my arm
      to walk home, his anger had vanished, he spoke even with a sort of
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how it is, my dear, but the world is altering fast. People
      preach strange doctrines, and act in strange ways, such as were never
      thought of when I was young. It may be for good or for evil&mdash;I shall
      find out by-and-by. I was dreaming of your mother last night; you are
      growing very like her, child.&rdquo; Then suddenly, &ldquo;Only wait till I am dead,
      and you will be free, Theodora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart felt bursting; oh Max, you do not mind me telling you these
      things? What should I do if I could not thus open my heart to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it is not altogether with grief, or without hope, that I have thought
      over what then passed between papa and me. He knows you&mdash;knows too
      that neither you nor I have ever deceived him in anything. He was fond of
      you once; I think sometimes he misses you still, in little things wherein
      you used to pay him attention, less like a friend than a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Max, do not think I am grieving&mdash;do not imagine I have cause to
      grieve. They are as kind to me as ever they can be. My home is as happy as
      any home could be made, except one, which, whether we shall ever find or
      not, God knows. In quiet evenings such as this, when, after a rainy day,
      it has just cleared up in time for the sun to go down, and he is going
      down peacefully in amber glory, with the trees standing up so purple and
      still, and the moorlands lying bright, and the hills distinct even to
      their very last faint rim&mdash;in such evenings as this, Max, when I want
      you and cannot find you, but have to learn to sit still by myself, as now,
      I learn to think also of the meeting which has no farewell, of the rest
      that comes to all in time, of the eternal home. We shall reach that&mdash;some
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your faithful,
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora.

      CHAPTER VIII. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Treherne Court,</i> <i>Sunday night.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y Dear Theodora,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer to my telegram has just arrived, and I find it is your sister
      whom we are to expect, not you. I shall meet her myself by the night
      train, Treherne being quite incapable; indeed, he will hardly stir from
      the corridor that leads to his wife's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have heard already that the heir so ardently looked for has only
      lived a few hours. Lady Augusta's letters, which she gave me to address,
      and I took care to post myself, would have assured you of your sister's
      safety, though it was long doubtful. It will comfort you to know that she
      is in excellent care, both her medical attendants being known to me
      professionally, and Lady Augusta, being a real mother to her, in
      tenderness and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will wonder how I came here. It was by accident&mdash;taking a
      Saturday holiday, which is advisable now and then; and Treherne's mother
      detained me, as being the only person who had any control over her son.
      Poor fellow! he was almost out of his mind. He never had any trouble
      before, and he knows not how to bear it. He trembled in terror&mdash;thus
      coming face to face with that messenger of God who puts an end to all
      merely mortal joys&mdash;was paralyzed at the fear of losing his
      blessings, which, numerous as they are, are all of this world. My love,
      whom I thought to have seen to-night, but shall not see&mdash;for how
      long?&mdash;things are more equally balanced than we suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be sorry about the little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treherne seems indifferent; his whole thought being, naturally, his wife;
      but Sir William is grievously disappointed. A son too&mdash;and he had
      planned bonfires, and bell-ringings, and rejoicings all over the estate.
      When he stood looking at the little white lump of clay, which is the only
      occupant of the grand nursery, prepared for the heir of Treherne Court, I
      heard the old man sigh as if for a great misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will think it none, since your sister lives. Be quite content about
      her&mdash;which is easy for me to say, when I know how long and anxious
      the days will seem at Rockmount. It might have been better, for some
      things, if you, rather than Miss Johnston, had come to take charge of your
      sister during her recovery; but, maybe, all is well as it is. To-morrow I
      shall leave this great house, with its many happinesses, which have run so
      near a chance of being overthrown, and go back to my own solitary life, in
      which nothing of personal interest ever visits me but Theodora's letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two things I intended to tell you in my Sunday letter; shall I
      say them still? for the more things you have to think about the better,
      and one of them was my reason for suggesting your presence here, rather
      than your eldest sister's.&mdash;(Do not imagine though, your coming was
      urged by me wholly for other people's sakes. The sight of you&mdash;-just
      for a few hours&mdash;one hour&mdash;People talk of water in the desert&mdash;the
      thought of a green field to those who have been months at sea&mdash;well,
      that is what a glimpse of your little face would be to me. But I cannot
      get it&mdash;and I must not moan.)
    </p>
    <p>
      What was I writing about? oh, to bid you tell Mrs. Cartwright from me that
      her daughter is well in health and doing well. After her two months'
      probation here, the governor, to whom alone I communicated her history
      (names omitted) pronounces her quite fitted for the situation. And she
      will be formally appointed thereto. This is a great satisfaction to me&mdash;as
      she was selected solely on my recommendation, backed by Mrs. Ansdell's
      letter. Say also to the old woman, that I trust she receives regularly the
      money her daughter sends her through me; which indeed is the only time I
      ever see Lydia alone. But I meet her often in the wards, as she goes from
      cell to cell, teaching the female prisoners; and it is good to see her
      sweet grave looks, her decent dress and mien, and her unexpressible
      humility and gentleness towards everybody.&mdash;She puts me in mind of
      words you know&mdash;which in another sense, other hearts than poor
      Lydia's might often feel&mdash;that those love most to whom most has been
      forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hinting this, though not in reference to her, in a conversation with the
      governor, he observed, rather coldly, &ldquo;He had heard it said Doctor
      Urquhart held peculiar opinions upon crime and punishment&mdash;that, in
      fact, he was a little too charitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sighed&mdash;thinking that of all men, Doctor Urquhart was the one who
      had the most reason to be charitable: and the governor fixed his eyes upon
      me somewhat unpleasantly. Anyone running counter, as I do, to several
      popular prejudices, is sure not to be without enemies. I should be sorry,
      though, to have displeased so honest a man, and one whom, widely as we
      differ in some things, is always safe to deal with, from his possessing
      that rare quality&mdash;justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, I go on writing to you of my matters&mdash;just as I should talk
      to you if you sat by my side now, with your hand in mine, and your head,
      here. (So you found two grey hairs in those long locks of yours last week.
      Never mind, love. To me you will be always young.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I write as I hope to talk to you one day. I never was among those who
      believe that a man should keep all his cares secret from his wife. If she
      is a true wife, she will soon read them on his face, or the effect of
      them; he had better tell them out and have them over. I have learnt many
      things, since I found my Theodora: among the rest is, that when a man
      marries, or loves with the hope of marrying, let him have been ever so
      reserved, his whole nature opens out&mdash;he becomes another creature; in
      degree towards everybody, but most of all to her he has chosen. How
      altered I am&mdash;you would smile to see, were my little lady to compare
      these long letters, with the brief, businesslike productions which have
      heretofore borne the signature &ldquo;Max Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I prize my name a little. It has been honourable for a number of years. My
      father was proud of it, and Dallas. Do you like it? Will you like it when&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;No,
      let me trust in heaven, and say, <i>when</i> you bear it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those papers of mine which you saw mentioned in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;I
      am glad Mr. Johnston read them; or at least you suppose he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe they are doing good, and that my name is becoming pretty well
      known in connection with them, especially in this town. A provincial
      reputation has its advantages; it is more undoubted&mdash;more complete.
      In London, a man may shirk and hide; his nearest acquaintance can scarcely
      know him thoroughly; but in the provinces it is different. There, if he
      has a flaw in him, either as to his antecedents, his character, or
      conduct, be sure scandal will find it out; for she has every opportunity.
      Also, public opinion is at once stricter and more narrow-minded in a place
      like this than in a great metropolis. I am glad to be earning a good name
      here, in this honest, hard-working, commercial district, where my fortunes
      are apparently cast; and where, having been a &ldquo;rolling stone&rdquo; all my life,
      I mean to settle and &ldquo;gather moss,&rdquo; if I can. Moss to make a little nest
      soft and warm for&mdash;my love knows who.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing this, about the impossibility of keeping anything secret in a town
      like this, reminds me of something which I was in doubt about telling you
      or not: finally, I have decided that I will tell you. Your sister being
      absent, will make things easier for you. You will not have need to use any
      of those concealments which must be so painful in a home. Nevertheless, I
      do think Miss Johnston ought to be kept ignorant of the fact that I
      believe, nay, am almost certain, Mr. Francis Charteris is at this present
      time living in Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that all my inquiries about him in London failed. He has just
      been discharged from this very gaol. It is more than likely he was
      arrested for liabilities long owing; or contracted after his last
      fruitless visit to his uncle, Sir William. I could easily find out, but
      hardly consider it delicate to make inquiries, as I did not, you know,
      after the debtor&mdash;whom a turnkey here reported to have said he knew
      me. Debtors are not criminals by law&mdash;their ward is justly held
      private. I never visit any of them unless they come into hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore my meeting with Mr. Charteris was purely accidental. Nor do I
      believe he recognised me&mdash;I had stepped aside into the warder's room.
      The two other discharged debtors passed through the entrance-gate, and
      quitted the gaol immediately; but he lingered, desiring a car to be sent
      for&mdash;and inquiring where one could get handsome and comfortable
      lodgings in this horrid Liverpool. He hated a commercial town.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will ask, woman-like, how he looked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ill and worn, with something of the shabby, &ldquo;poor gentleman&rdquo; aspect, with
      which we here are only too familiar. I overheard the turnkey joking with
      the carman about taking him to &ldquo;handsome rooms.&rdquo; Also, there was about him
      an ominous air of what we in Scotland call the &ldquo;down-draught;&rdquo; a term, the
      full meaning of which you probably do not understand&mdash;I trust you
      never may.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You will see by its date how many days ago the first part of this letter
      was written. I kept it back till the cruel suspense of your sister's
      sudden relapse was ended&mdash;thinking it a pity your mind should be
      burthened with any additional care. You have had, in the meantime, the
      daily bulletin from Treherne Court&mdash;the daily line from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      How are you, my child?&mdash;for you have forgotten to say. Any roses out
      on your poor cheeks? Look in the glass and tell me. I must know, or I must
      come and see. Remember, your life is a part of mine, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Treherne is convalescent&mdash;as you know. I saw her on Monday for
      the first time. She is changed, certainly; it will be long before she is
      anything like the Lisabel Johnston of my recollection, full of health and
      physical enjoyment. But do not grieve. Sometimes, to have gone near the
      gates of death, and returned, hallows the whole future life. I thought, as
      I left her, lying contentedly on her sofa, with her hand in her husband's,
      who sits watching as if truly she were given back to him from the grave,
      that it may be good for those two to have been so nearly parted. It may
      teach them, according to a line you once repeated to me (you see, though I
      am not poetical, I remember all your bits of poetry), to
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;hold every mortal joy
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With a loose hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      since nothing finite is safe, unless overshadowed by the belief in, and
      the glory of, the Infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest&mdash;my best of every earthly thing&mdash;whom to be parted
      from temporarily, as now often makes me feel as if half myself were
      wanting&mdash;whom to lose out of this world would be a loss irremediable,
      and to leave behind in it would be the sharpest sting of death&mdash;better,
      I have sometimes thought, of late&mdash;better be you and I than Treherne
      and Lisabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all these letters I have scarcely mentioned Penelope&mdash;you see I am
      learning to name your sisters as if mine. She, however, has treated me
      almost like a stranger in the few times we happened to meet&mdash;until
      last Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had left the happy group in the library&mdash;Treherne, tearing himself
      from his wife's sofa&mdash;honest fellow! to follow me to the door&mdash;where
      he wrung my hand, and said, with a sob like a school-boy, that he had
      never been so happy in his life before, and he hoped he was thankful for
      it. Your eldest sister, who sat in the window sewing&mdash;her figure put
      me somewhat in mind of you, little lady&mdash;bade me good-bye&mdash;she
      was going back to Rockmount in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quitted them, and walked alone across the park, where the chestnut-trees&mdash;you
      remember them&mdash;are beginning, not only to change, but to fall;
      thinking how fast the years go, and how little there is in them of
      positive joy. Wrong&mdash;this!&mdash;and I know it; but, my love, I sin
      sorely at times. I nearly forgot a small patient I have at the
      lodge-gates, who is slipping so gradually, but surely, poor wee man! into
      the world where he will be a child for ever. After sitting with him half
      an hour, I came out better.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady was waiting outside the lodge-gates. When I saw who it was, I meant
      to bow and pass on, but Miss Johnston called me. From her face, I dreaded
      it was some ill news about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sister is a good woman and a kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to me, when her explanations had set my mind at ease:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, I believe you are a man to be trusted. Dora trusts you.
      Dora once said, you would be just, even to your enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered, I hoped it was something more than justice, that we owed even
      to our enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question,&rdquo; she said, sharply; &ldquo;I spoke only of justice. I
      would not do an injustice to the meanest thing&mdash;the vilest wretch
      that crawls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not liked you, Dr. Urquhart: nor do I know if my feelings are
      altered now&mdash;but I respect you. Therefore, you are the only person of
      whom I can ask a favour. It is a secret. Will you keep it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except from Theodora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Have no secrets from Theodora. For her sake, and your own&mdash;for
      your whole life's peace&mdash;never, even in the lightest thing, deceive
      that poor child!&rdquo; Her voice sharpened, her black eyes glittered a moment,
      and then she shrank back into her usual self. I see exactly the sort of
      woman, which, as you say, she will grow into&mdash;sister Penelope&mdash;aunt
      Penelope. Every one belonging to her must try, henceforth, to spare her
      every possible pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments, I begged her to say what I could do for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this letter, and tell me if you think it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was addressed to Sir William Treherne; the last humble appeal of a
      broken-down man; the signature &ldquo;Francis Charteris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried my best to disguise the emotion which Miss Johnston herself did
      not show, and returned the letter, merely inquiring if Sir William had
      answered it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He will not. He disbelieves the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say. The&mdash;the writer was not always accurate in his
      statements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Women are, in some things, stronger and harder than men. I doubt if any
      man could have spoken as steadily as your sister did at this minute. While
      I explained to her, as I thought it right to do, though with the manner of
      one talking of a stranger to a stranger&mdash;the present position of Mr.
      Charteris, she replied not a syllable. Only passing a felled tree&mdash;she
      suddenly sank down upon it, and sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he to do?&rdquo; she said, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied that the Insolvent Court could free him from his debts, and
      grant him protection from further imprisonment; that though thus sunk in
      circumstances, a Government situation was hardly to be hoped for, still
      there were in Liverpool, clerkships and mercantile opportunities, in which
      any person so well educated as he, might begin the world again&mdash;health
      permitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His health was never good&mdash;has it failed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your sister turned away. She sat&mdash;we both sat&mdash;for some time, so
      still that a bright-eyed squirrel came and peeped at us, stole a nut a few
      yards off, and scuttled away with it to Mrs. Squirrel and the little ones
      up in a tall sycamore hard by.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged Miss Johnston to let me see the address once more, and I would
      pay a visit, friendly or medical, as the case might allow, to Mr.
      Charteris, on my way home to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Doctor Urquhart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I then rose and took leave, time being short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, one word if you please. In that visit, you will of course say, if
      inquired, that you learnt the address from Treherne Court. You will, name
      no other names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But afterwards, you will write to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands, and I left her sitting there on the dead tree. I went on,
      wondering if anything would result from this curious combination of
      accidents: also, whether a woman's love, if cut off at the root, even like
      this tree, could be actually killed, so that nothing could revive it
      again. What think you, Theodora?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this trick of moralizing, caught from you, shall not be indulged.
      There is only time for the relation of bare facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train brought me to the opposite shore of our river, not half a mile's
      walk from Mr. Charteris's lodgings. They seemed &ldquo;handsome lodgings&rdquo; as he
      said&mdash;a tall new house, one of the many which, only half-built, or
      half-inhabited, make this Birkenhead such a dreary place. But it is
      improving, year by year&mdash;I sometimes think it may be quite a busy and
      cheerful spot by the time I take a house here, as I intend. You will like
      a hill-top, and a view of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked for Mr. Charteris, and stumbled up the half-lighted stairs, into
      the wholly dark drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil's there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in hiding, you must remember, as indeed I ought to have done, and
      so taken the precaution first to send up my name&mdash;but I was afraid of
      non-admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gas was lit, his pale, unshaven, sallow countenance, his state of
      apparent illness and weakness, made me cease to regret having gained
      entrance, under any circumstances. Recognizing me, he muttered some
      apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was asleep&mdash;I usually do sleep after dinner.&rdquo; Then recovering his
      confused faculties, he asked with some <i>hauteur</i>, &ldquo;To what may I
      attribute the pleasure of seeing Doctor Urquhart? Are you, like myself, a
      mere bird of passage, or a resident in Liverpool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surgeon of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; gaol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I was not aware. A good appointment I hope? And what gaol did you
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I named it again, and left the subject. If he chose to wrap himself in
      that thin cloak of deception, it was no business of mine to tear it off.
      Besides, one pities a ruined man's most petty pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was an awkward position. You know how haughty Mr. Charteris can be;
      you know also that unlucky peculiarity in me, call it Scotch shyness,
      cautiousness, or what you please, my little English girl must cure it, if
      she can. Whether or not it was my fault, I soon felt that this visit was
      turning out a complete failure. We conversed in the civillest manner,
      though somewhat disjointedly, on politics, the climate and trade of
      Liverpool, &amp;c., but of Mr. Charteris and his real condition, I learned
      no more than if I were meeting him at a London dinner-party, or a supper
      with poor Tom Turton&mdash;who is dead, as you know. Mr. Charteris did
      not, it seems, and his startled exclamation at hearing the fact was the
      own natural expression during my whole visit. Which, after a few rather
      broad hints, I took the opportunity of a letter's being brought in, to
      terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, however, with any intention on my side of its being a final one. The
      figure of this wretched-looking invalid, though he would not own to
      illness&mdash;men seldom will&mdash;lying in the solitary, fireless
      lodging-house parlor, where there was no indication of food, and a strong
      smell of opium&mdash;followed me all the way to the jetty, suggesting plan
      after plan concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot think how pretty even our dull river looks of a night, with its
      two long lines of lighted shores, and other lights scattered between in
      all directions, <i>every</i> vessel's rigging bearing one. And to-night,
      above all things, was a large bright moon, sailing up over innumerable
      white clouds, into the clear dark zenith, converting the town of Liverpool
      into a fairy city, and the muddy Mersey into a pleasant river, crossed by
      a pathway of silver&mdash;such as one always looks at with a kind of hope
      that it would lead to &ldquo;some bright isle of rest.&rdquo; There was a song to that
      effect popular when Dallas and I were boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the boat moved off, I settled myself to enjoy the brief seven minutes
      of crossing&mdash;thinking, if I had but the little face by me looking up
      into the moonlight she is so fond of, the little hand to keep warm in
      mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Theodora, I come to something which you must use your own
      judgment about telling your sister Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way across, I was attracted by the peculiar manner of a passenger,
      who had leaped on the boat just as we were shoved off, and now stood still
      as a carved figure, staring down into the foamy track of the
      paddle-wheels. He was so absorbed that he did not notice me, but I
      recognized him at once, and an ugly suspicion entered my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my time, I have had opportunities of witnessing, stage by stage, that
      disease&mdash;call it dyspepsia, hypochondriasis, or what you will&mdash;it
      has all names and all forms&mdash;which is peculiar to our present state
      of high civilization, where the mind and the body seem cultivated into
      perpetual warfare one with the other. This state&mdash;some people put
      poetical names upon it&mdash;but we doctors know that it is at least as
      much physical as mental, and that many a poor misanthrope, who loathes
      himself and the world, is merely an unfortunate victim of stomach and
      nerves, whom rest, natural living, and an easy mind, would soon make a man
      again. But that does not remove the pitifulness and danger of the case.
      While the man is what he is, he is little better than a monomaniac.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had not seen him before, the expression of his countenance, as he
      stood looking down into the river, would have been enough to convince me
      how necessary it was to keep a strict watch over Mr. Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rush of passengers to the gangway made our side of the boat
      nearly deserted, he sprang up the steps of the paddle-box, and there
      stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once saw a man commit suicide. It was one of ours, returning from the
      Crimea. He had been drinking hard, and was put under restraint, for fear
      of delirium tremens; but when he was thought recovered, one day, at broad
      noon, in sight of all hands, he suddenly jumped overboard. I caught sight
      of his face as he did so&mdash;it was exactly the expression of Francis
      Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, in any case, you had better never repeat the whole of this to
      your sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till after a considerable struggle did I pull him down to the safe
      deck once more. There he stood breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not surely going to drown yourself, Mr. Charteris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was. And I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try,&mdash;and I shall call the police to prevent your making such an ass
      of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no time to choose words, and in this sort of disease the best
      preventive one can use, next to a firm, imperative will, is ridicule. He
      answered nothing&mdash;but gazed at me in simple astonishment, while I
      took his arm and led him out of the boat and across the landing-stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon for using such strong language, but a man must be an
      ass indeed, who contemplates such a thing;&mdash;here, too, of all places.
      To be fished up out of this dirty river like a dead rat, for the
      entertainment of the crowd; to make a capital case at the magistrate's
      court to-morrow, and a first-rate paragraph in the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i>,&mdash;'Attempted
      Suicide of a Gentleman.' Or, if you really succeeded, which I doubt, to be
      'Found Drowned,'&mdash;a mere body, drifted ashore with cocoa-nut husks
      and cabbages at Waterloo, or brought in as I once saw at these very
      stairs, one of the many poor fools who do this here yearly. They had
      picked him up eight miles higher up the river, and so brought him down,
      lashed behind a rowing-boat, floating face upwards&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt Charteris shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will, too, my love, so I will repeat no more of what I said to him.
      But these ghastly pictures were the strongest arguments available with
      such a man. What was the use of talking to him of God, and life, and
      immortality? he had told me he believed in none of these things. But he
      believed in death&mdash;the epicurean's view of it&mdash;&ldquo;to lie in cold
      obstruction and to rot.&rdquo; I thought, and still think, that it was best to
      use any lawful means to keep him from repeating the attempt. Best to save
      the man first, and preach to him afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and I walked up and down the streets of Liverpool almost in silence,
      except when he darted into the first chemist's shop he saw to procure
      opium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't hinder me,&rdquo; he said, imploringly, &ldquo;it is the only thing that keeps
      me alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I walked him about once more, till his pace flagged, his limbs
      tottered, he became thoroughly passive and exhausted. I called a car, and
      expressed my determination to see him safe home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home! No, no, I must not go there.&rdquo; And the poor fellow summoned all his
      faculties, in order to speak rationally. &ldquo;You see, a gentleman in my
      unpleasant circumstances&mdash;in short, could you recommend any place&mdash;a
      quiet, out-of-the-way place, where&mdash;where I could hide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had suspected things were thus. And now, if I lost sight of him even for
      twenty-four hours, he might be lost permanently. He was in that critical
      state, when the next step, if it were not to a prison, might be into a
      lunatic asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not difficult to persuade him that the last place where creditors
      would search for a debtor would be inside a gaol, nor to convey him,
      half-stupefied as he was, into my own rooms, and leave him fast asleep on
      my bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, even now, I cannot account for the influence I so soon gained, and
      kept; except that any person in his seven senses always has power over
      another nearly out of them, and to a sick man there is no autocrat like
      the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for his present condition. The day following, I removed him to a
      country lodging, where an old woman I know will look after him. The place
      is humble enough, but they are honest people. He may lie safe there till
      some portion of health returns; his rent, &amp;c.&mdash;my prudent little
      lady will be sure to be asking after my &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;well, love,
      his rent for the next month at least, I can easily afford to pay. The
      present is provided for&mdash;as to his future, heaven only knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote, according to promise, to your sister Penelope, explaining where
      Mr. Charteris was, his state of health, and the position of his affairs;
      also, my advice, which he neither assents to nor declines, that as soon as
      his health will permit, he should surrender himself in London, go through
      the Insolvent Court, and start anew in life. A hard life, at best, since,
      whatever situation he may obtain, it will take years to free him from all
      his liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Johnston's answer I received this morning. It was merely an envelope
      containing a bank note of 20L. Sir William's gift, possibly; I told her he
      had better be made aware of his nephew's abject state,&mdash;or do you
      suppose it is from herself? I thought beyond your quarterly allowance, you
      had none of you much ready money? If there is anything I ought to know
      before applying this sum to the use of Mr. Charteris, you will, of course,
      tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been to see him this afternoon. It is a poor room he lies in, but
      clean and quiet. He will not stir out of it; it was with difficulty I
      persuaded him to have the window opened, so that we might enjoy the still
      autumn sunshine, the church-bells, and the little robin's song. Turning
      back to the sickly drawn face, buried in the sofa-pillows, my heart smote
      me with a heavy doubt as to what was to be the end of Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I do not think he will die; but he will be months, years in
      recovering, even if he is ever his old self again&mdash;bodily, I
      mean-whether his inner self is undergoing any change, I have small means
      of judging. The best thing for him, both mentally and physically, would be
      a fond, good woman's constant care; but that he cannot have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need scarcely say, I have taken every precaution that he should never
      see nor hear anything of Lydia; nor she of him. He has never named her,
      nor any one; past and future seem alike swept out of his mind; he only
      lives in the miserable present, a helpless, hopeless, exacting invalid.
      Not on any account would I have Lydia Cartwright see him now. If I judge
      her countenance rightly, she is just the girl to do exactly what you women
      are so prone to&mdash;forgive everything, sacrifice everything, and go
      back to the old love. Ah! Theodora, what am I that I should dare to speak
      thus lightly of women's love, women's forgiveness!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad Mr. Johnston allows you occasionally to see Mrs. Cartwright and
      the child, and that the little fellow is so well cared by his grandmother.
      If, with his father's face, he inherits his father's temperament, the
      nervously sensitive organization of a modern &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; as opposed to
      the healthy animalism of a working man, life will be an uphill road to
      that poor boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's heart aches after him sorely at times, as I can plainly
      perceive. Yesterday, I saw her stand watching the line of female convicts&mdash;those
      with infants&mdash;as one after the other they filed out, each with her
      baby in her arms, and passed into the exercising-ground. Afterwards, I
      watched her slip into one of the empty cells, fold up a child's cap that
      had been left lying about, and look at it wistfully, as if she almost
      envied the forlorn occupant of that dreary nook, where, at least, the
      mother had her child with her continually. Poor Lydia! she may have been a
      girl of weak will, easily led astray, but I am convinced that the only
      thing which led her astray must have been, and will always be, her
      affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, as the grandmother cannot write, it would be a comfort to Lydia,
      if your next letter enabled me to give to her a fuller account of the
      welfare of little Frank. I wonder, does his father ever think of him? or
      of the poor mother. He was &ldquo;always kind to them,&rdquo; you tell me she
      declared; possibly fond of them, so far as a selfish man can be. But how
      can such an one as he understand what it must be to be a <i>father!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, I must cease writing now. It is midnight, and I have to take as
      much sleep as I can; my work is very hard just at present; but happy work,
      because, through it, I look forward to a future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your father's brief message of thanks for my telegram about Mr. Treherne,
      was kind. Will you acknowledge it in the way you consider would be most
      pleasing; that is, least unpleasing, to him, from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, farewell&mdash;farewell, my only darling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;After the fashion of a lady's letter, though not, I trust, with
      the most important fact therein. Though I re-open my letter to inform you
      of it, lest you might learn it in some other way, I consider it of very
      slight moment, and only name it because these sort of small
      unpleasantnesses have a habit of growing like snow-balls, every yard they
      roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our chaplain has just shown me in this morning's paper a paragraph about
      myself, not complimentary, and decidedly ill-natured. It hardly took me by
      surprise; I have of late occasionally caught stray comments, not very
      flattering, on myself and my proceedings, but they troubled me little. I
      know that a man in my position, with aims far beyond his present
      circumstances, with opinions too obstinate and manners too blunt to get
      these aims carried out, as many do, by the aid of other and more
      influential people, such a man <i>must</i> have enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be not afraid, love&mdash;mine are few; and be sure I have given them no
      cause for animosity. True, I have contradicted some, and not many men can
      stand contradiction&mdash;but I have wronged no man to my knowledge. My
      conscience is clear. So they may spread what absurd reports or innuendoes
      they will&mdash;I shall live it all down.
    </p>
    <p>
      My spirit seems to have had a douche-bath this morning, cold, but
      salutary. This tangible annoyance will brace me out of a little
      feebleheartedness that has been growing over me of late; so be content, my
      Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      I send you the newspaper paragraph. Read it, and burn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Penelope come home? I need scarcely observe, that only herself and you
      are acquainted, or will be, with any of the circumstances I have related
      with respect to Mr. Charteris.

      CHAPTER IX. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> fourth Monday,
      and my letter has not come. Oh, Max, Max!&mdash;You are not ill, I know;
      for Augustus saw you on Saturday. Why were you in such haste to slip away
      from him? He himself even noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, had I not then heard of your wellbeing, I should have disquieted
      myself sorely. Three weeks&mdash;twenty-one days&mdash;it is a long time
      to go about as if there were a stone lying in the corner of one's heart,
      or a thorn piercing it. One may not acknowledge this: one's reason, or
      better, one's love, may often quite argue it down; yet, it is there. This
      morning, when the little postman went whistling past Rockmount gate, I
      turned almost sick with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understand me&mdash;not with one sort of fear. Faithlessness or
      forgetfulness are&mdash;Well, with, you they are&mdash;simply impossible!
      But you are my Max; anything happening to you happens to me; nothing can
      hurt you without hurting me. Do you feel this as I do? if so, surely,
      under any circumstances, you would write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive! I meant not to blame you; we never ought to blame what we cannot
      understand. Besides, all this suspense may end to-morrow. Max does not
      intend to wound me; Max loves me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, sitting quiet, I seemed to hear you saying: &ldquo;My little lady,&rdquo; as
      distinctly as if you were close at hand, and had called me. Yet it is a
      year since I have heard the sound of your voice, or seen your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus says, of late you have turned quite grey. Never, mind, Max! I
      like silver locks. An old man I knew used to say, &ldquo;At the root of every
      grey hair is a eell of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How will you be able to bear with the foolishness of this me? Yet, all the
      better for you. I know you would soon be ten years younger&mdash;looks and
      all&mdash;if, after your hard work, you had a home to come back to, and&mdash;and
      <i>me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See how conceited we grow! See the demoralizing result of having been for
      a whole year loved and cared for; of knowing ourselves, for the first time
      in our lives, first object to somebody!
    </p>
    <p>
      There now, I can laugh again; and so I may begin and write my letter. It
      shall not be a sad or complaining letter, if I can help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring is coming on fast. I never remember such a March. Buds of chestnuts
      bursting, blackbirds singing, primroses out in the lane, a cloud of snowy
      wind-flowers gleaming through the trees of my favourite wood, concerning
      which, you remember, we had our celebrated battle about blue-bells and
      hyacinths. These are putting out their leaves already; there will be such
      quantities this year. How I should like to show you my bank of&mdash;ahem!
      <i>blue-bells!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mischievous still, you perceive. Obstinate, likewise; almost as obstinate
      as&mdash;you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustus hints at some &ldquo;unpleasant business&rdquo; you have been engaged in
      lately. I conclude some controversy, in which you have had to &ldquo;hold your
      own&rdquo; more firmly than usual. Or new &ldquo;enemies,&rdquo;&mdash;business foes only of
      course, about which you told me I must never grieve, as they were
      unavoidable. I do not grieve; you will live down any passing animosity. It
      will be all smooth sailing by-and-by. But in the meantime, why not tell
      me? I am not a child&mdash;and&mdash;I am to be your wife, Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, now the thorn is out, the one little sting of pain. It isn't this
      child you were fond of, this ignorant, foolish, naughty child, it is your
      wife, whom you yourself chose, to whom you yourself gave her place and her
      rights, who comes to you with her heart full of love and says, &ldquo;Max, tell
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, no more of this, for I have much to tell you&mdash;I tell <i>you</i>
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know how quietly this winter has slipped away with us at. Rockmount;
      how, from the time Penelope returned, she and I seemed to begin our lives
      anew together, in one sense beginning almost as little children, living
      entirely in the present; content with each day's work-and each day's
      pleasure,&mdash;and it was wonderful how many small pleasures we found&mdash;never
      allowing ourselves either to dwell on the future or revert to the past.
      Except when by your desire. I told my sister of Francis's having passed
      through the Insolvent Court, and how you were hoping to obtain for him a
      situation as corresponding clerk. Poor Francis! all his grand German and
      Spanish to have sunk down to the writing of a merchant's business-letters,
      in a musty Liverpool office! Will he ever bear it? Well, except this time,
      and once afterwards, his name has never been mentioned, either by Penelope
      or me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time happened thus&mdash;I did not tell you then, so I will
      now. When our Christmas bills came in&mdash;our private ones, my sister
      had no money to meet them. I soon guessed that&mdash;as, from your letter,
      I had already guessed where her half-yearly allowance had gone. I was
      perplexed, for though she now confides to me nearly everything of her
      daily concerns, she has never told me <i>that</i>. Yet she must have known
      I knew&mdash;that you would be sure to tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one morning, as I was passing the door of her room, she called me
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing before a chest-of-drawers, which, I had noticed, she
      always kept locked. But to-day the top drawer was open, and out of a small
      jewel-case that lay on it, she had taken a string of pearls. &ldquo;You remember
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes! But Penelope looked steadily at it; so, of course, did I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea, Dora, what it is worth, or how much Sir William gave
      for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew: for Lisabel had told me herself, in the days when we were all
      racking our brains to find out suitable marriage presents for the
      governor's lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it would be wrong, or that the Trehernes would be annoyed,
      if I sold it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money&mdash;and my bills must be paid. It is not dishonest to
      sell what is one's own, though it may be somewhat painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could say nothing. The pain was keen&mdash;even to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then reminded me how Mrs. Granton had once admired these pearls,
      saying, when Colin married she should like to give her daughter-in-law
      just such another necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she would buy it now&mdash;if you would not mind asking her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Dora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She replaced the necklace in its case, and gave it into my hand. I was
      slipping out of the room, when she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, child. There was something more I wished to say to you. Look
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She unlocked drawer after drawer. There lay, carefully arranged, all her
      wedding clothes, even to the white silk dress, the wreath and veil.
      Everything was put away in Penelope's own tidy, over-particular fashion,
      wrapped in silver paper, or smoothly folded, with sprigs of lavender
      between. She must have done it leisurely and orderly, after her peculiar
      habit, which made us, when she was only a girl of seventeen, teaze
      Penelope by calling her &ldquo;old maid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even now, she paused more than once, to re-fold or re-arrange something&mdash;tenderly,
      as one would arrange the clothes of a person who was dead&mdash;then
      closed and locked every drawer, putting the key, not on her
      household-bunch, but in a corner of her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like anything touched in my lifetime, but, should I die&mdash;not
      that this is likely; I believe I shall live to be an old woman&mdash;still,
      should I die, you will know, where these things are. Do with them exactly
      what you think best. And if money is wanted for&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, and
      then, for the first time, I heard her pronounce his name, distinctly and
      steadily, like any other name, &ldquo;for Francis Charteris, or any one
      belonging to him&mdash;sell them. You will promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Granton, dear soul! asked no questions, but took the necklace, and
      gave me the money, which I brought to my sister. She received it without a
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, all went on as heretofore; and though sometimes I have felt
      her eye upon me when I was opening your letters, as if she fancied there
      might be something to hear, still, since there never was anything, I
      thought it best to take no notice. But Max, I wished often, and wish now,
      that you would tell me if there is any special reason why, for so many
      weeks, you have never mentioned Francis?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was telling you about Penelope. She has fallen into her old busy ways&mdash;busier
      than ever, indeed. She looks well too, &ldquo;quite herself again,&rdquo; as Mrs.
      Granton whispered to me, one morning when&mdash;wonderful event&mdash;I
      had persuaded my sister that we ought to drive over to lunch at the
      Cedars, and admire all the preparations for the reception of Mrs. Colin,
      next month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have liked to ask her,&rdquo; added the good old lady; &ldquo;but since
      she did come, I am glad. The sight of my young folk's happiness will not
      pain her? She has really got over her trouble, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I said hastily, for Penelope was coming up the greenhouse
      walk. Yet when I observed her, it seemed not herself but a new self&mdash;such
      as is only born of sorrow which smiled out of her poor thin face, made her
      move softly, speak affectionately, and listen patiently to all the
      countless details about &ldquo;my Colin&rdquo; and &ldquo;my daughter Emily,&rdquo; (bless the
      dear old lady, I hope she will find her a real daughter). And though most
      of the way home we were both more silent than usual, something in
      Penelope's countenance made me, not sad or anxious, but inly awed,
      marvelling at its exceeding peace. A peace such as I could have imagined
      in those who had brought all their earthly possessions and laid them at
      the apostles' feet; or holier still, and therefore happier,&mdash;who had
      left all, taken up their cross, and followed <i>Him</i>. Him who through
      His life and death taught the perfection of all sacrifice, self-sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may write thus, Max, may I not? It is like talking to myself, talking to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this very drive home that something happened, which I am going
      to relate as literally as I can, for I think you ought to know it. It will
      make you love my sister as I love her, which is saying a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her, I almost&mdash;forgive, dear Max!&mdash;but I almost forgot
      my letter to you, safely written overnight, to be posted on our way home
      from the Cedars; till Penelope thought of a village post-office we had
      just passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't vex yourself, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you shall cross the moor again;
      you will be quite in time; and I will drive round, and meet you just
      beyond the ponds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in my hurry, utterly forgot that cottage you know, which she has
      never yet been near, nor is aware who live in it. Not till I had posted my
      letter, did I call to mind that she would be passing Mrs. Cartwright's
      very door!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was too late to alter plans, so I resolved not to fret about
      it. And, somehow, the spring feeling came over me; the smell of
      furze-blossoms, and of green leaves budding; the vague sense as if some
      new blessing were coming with the coming year. And, though I had not Max
      with me, to admire my one stray violet that I found, and listen to my lark&mdash;the
      first, singing up in his white cloud, still I thought of you, and I loved
      you! With a love that, I think, those only feel who have suffered, and
      suffered together: a love that, though it may have known a few pains, has
      never, thank God, known a single doubt. And so you did not feel so very
      far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I walked on as fast as I could, to meet the pony-carriage, which I
      saw crawling along the road round the turn&mdash;past the very cottage. My
      heart beat so! But Penelope drove quietly on, looking straight before her.
      She would have driven by in a minute; when, right across the road, in
      front of the pony, after a dog or something, I saw run a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I got to the spot I hardly know; how the child escaped I know still
      less; it was almost a miracle. But there stood Penelope, with the little
      fellow in her arms. He was unhurt&mdash;not even frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took him from her&mdash;she was still too bewildered to observe him much&mdash;besides,
      a child alters so in six months. &ldquo;He is all right you see. Run away,
      little man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! there is his mother to be thought of,&rdquo; said Penelope; &ldquo;where does
      he live? whose child is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could answer, the grandmother ran out, calling &ldquo;Franky&mdash;Franky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all over. No concealment was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my sister sit down by the roadside, and there, with her head on my
      shoulder, she sat till her deadly paleness passed away, and two tears
      slowly rose and rolled down her cheeks; but she said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I impressed upon her what a great comfort it was that the boy had
      escaped without one scratch; for there he stood, having once more got away
      from his granny, staring at us, finger in mouth, with intense curiosity
      and enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with you! &ldquo;&mdash;I cried more than once. But he kept his ground; and
      when I rose to put him away&mdash;my sister held me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often I have noticed, that in her harshest days Penelope never disliked
      nor was disliked by children. She had a sort of instinct for them. They
      rarely vexed her, as we, or her servants, or her big scholars always
      unhappily contrived to do. And she could always manage them, from the
      squalling baby that she stopped to pat at a cottage door, to the raggedest
      young scamp in the village, whom she would pick up after a pitched battle,
      give a good scolding to, then hear all his tribulations, dry his dirty
      face, and send him away with a broad grin upon it, such as was upon
      Franky's now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came nearer, and put his brown little paws upon Penelope's silk gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pony,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;Dora, go and see after the pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when I was gone, and she thought herself unseen, I saw her coax the
      little lad to her side, to her arms, hold him there and kiss him;&mdash;oh!
      Max, I can't write of it; I could not tell it to anybody but you.
    </p>
    <p>
      After keeping away as long as was practicable, I returned, to find Franky
      gone, and my sister walking slowly up and down; her veil was down, but her
      voice and step had their usual &ldquo;old-maidish&rdquo; quietness,&mdash;if I dared
      without a sob at the heart, even think that word concerning our Penelope!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her to get into the carriage, I just ran into the cottage to tell
      Mrs. Cartwright what had happened, and assure her that the child had
      received no possible harm; when, who should I see sitting over the fire
      but the last person I ever expected to see in that place!
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you know it?&mdash;was it by your advice he came?&mdash;what could be
      his motive in coming? or was it done merely for a whim&mdash;-just like
      Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anywhere else I believe I could not have recognised him. Not from his
      shabbiness; even in rags Francis would be something of the gentleman; but
      from his utterly broken-down appearance, his look of hopeless
      indifference, settled discontent; the air of a man who has tried all
      things and found them vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing me, he instinctively set down the child, who clung to his knees,
      screaming loudly to &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis blushed violently, and then laughed. &ldquo;The brat owns me, you see;
      he has not forgotten me&mdash;likes me also a little, which cannot be said
      for most people. Heyday, no getting rid of him? Come along then, young
      man; I must e'en make the best of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franky, nothing loth, clambered up, hugged him smotheringly round the
      neck, and broke into his own triumphant &ldquo;Ha! ha! he! &ldquo;&mdash;His father
      turned and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, somehow, I felt as if, it were easier to speak to Francis Charteris.
      Only a word or two&mdash;enquiries about his health&mdash;how long he had
      left Liverpool&mdash;and whether he meant to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Only a day's holiday. A horse in a mill&mdash;that is what I
      am now. Nothing for it but to grind on to the end of the chapter&mdash;eh,
      Franky my boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! he!&rdquo; screamed the child, with another delighted hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems fond of you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; he always was.&rdquo; Francis sighed. I am sure, nature was tugging
      hard at the selfish pleasure-loving heart. And pity&mdash;I know it was
      not wrong, Max!&mdash;was pulling sore at mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I had heard of his illness in the winter, and was glad to find him
      so much recovered:&mdash;how long had he been about again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long? Indeed I forget. I am so apt to forget things now. Except &ldquo;&mdash;he
      added bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;the clerk's stool and the office window with the
      spider-webs over it&mdash;and the thirty shillings a-week. That's my
      income, Dora&mdash;I beg your pardon, Miss Dora,&mdash;I forgot I was no
      longer a gentleman, but a clerk at thirty shillings a-week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said, I did not see why that should make him less of a gentleman; and,
      broken-down as he was,&mdash;sitting crouching over the fire with his
      sickly cheek passed against that rosy one,&mdash;I fancied I saw something
      of the man&mdash;the honest, true man&mdash;flash across the forlorn
      aspect of poor Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have liked to stay and talk with him, and said so, but my sister
      was outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she? will she be coming in here?&rdquo;&mdash;And he shrank nervously into
      his corner. &ldquo;I have been so ill, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He need not be afraid, I told him&mdash;we should have driven off in two
      minutes. There was not the slightest chance of their meeting&mdash;in all
      human probability he would never meet her more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not thought to see him so much affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, Dora, I never did deserve Penelope&mdash;yet there is
      something I should like to have said to her. Stop, hold back the curtain&mdash;she
      cannot see me sitting here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, as she drove slowly past, Francis watched her; I felt more than glad&mdash;proud
      that he should see the face which he had known blooming and young, and
      which would never be either the one or the other again in this world, and
      that he should see how peaceful and good it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is altered strangely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked, in momentary fear, did he think her looking out of health?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;It is not that. I hardly know what it is;&rdquo; then, as with a
      sudden impulse, &ldquo;I must go and speak to Penelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before I could hinder him, he was at the carriage side.
    </p>
    <p>
      No fear of a &ldquo;scene.&rdquo; They met&mdash;oh Max, can any two people so meet
      who have been lovers for ten years!
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been that the emotion of the last few minutes left her in
      that state when no occurrence seemed unexpected or strange&mdash;but
      Penelope, when she saw him, only gave a slight start;&mdash;and then
      looked at him, straight in the face, for a minute or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to see that you have been ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That one sentence must have struck him, as it did me, with the full
      conviction of how they met&mdash;as Penelope and Francis no more&mdash;merely
      Miss Johnston and Mr. Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been ill,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Almost at death's door. I should
      have died, but for Doctor Urquhart and&mdash;one other person, whose name
      I discovered by accident. I beg to thank her for her charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blushed scarlet in pronouncing the word. My sister tried to speak, but
      he stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Needless to deny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never deny what is true,&rdquo; said Penelope gravely. &ldquo;I only did what I
      considered right, and what I would have done for any person whom I had
      known so many years. Nor would I have done it at all, but that your uncle
      refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had rather owe it to you&mdash;twenty times over!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Nay&mdash;you
      shall not be annoyed with gratitude&mdash;I came but to own my debt&mdash;to
      say, if I live, I will repay it; if I die&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked keenly at him:&mdash;&ldquo;You will not die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What have I to live for&mdash;a ruined, disappointed, disgraced
      man? No, no&mdash;my chance is over for this world, and I do not care how
      soon I get out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather hear of your living worthily in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is not too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope's voice was very earnest, and had a slight falter that startled
      even me. No wonder it misled Francis,&mdash;he who never had a
      particularly low opinion of himself, and who for so many years had been
      fully aware of a fact&mdash;which, I once heard Max say, ought always to
      make a man humble rather than vain&mdash;how deeply a fond woman had loved
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you have no cause for all this despair. You are a young man still;
      your health may improve; you are free from debt, and have enough to live
      upon. Whatever disagreeables your position has, it is a beginning&mdash;you
      may rise. A long and prosperous career may lie before you yet&mdash;I hope
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max, I trembled. For he looked at her as he used to look when they were
      young. And it seems so hard to believe that love ever can die out. I
      thought, what if this exceeding calmness of my sister's should be only the
      cloak which pride puts on to hide intolerable pain?&mdash;But I was
      mistaken. And now I marvel, not that he, but that I&mdash;who know my
      sister as a sister ought&mdash;could for an instant have seen in those
      soft sad eyes anything beyond what her words expressed the more plainly,
      as they were such extremely kind and gentle words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis came closer, and said something in a low voice, of which I caught
      only the last sentence,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope, will you trust me again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would have slipped away&mdash;but my sister detained me; tightly her
      fingers closed on mine; but she answered Francis composedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite comprehend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you forgive and forget? will you marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis!&rdquo; I exclaimed, indignantly; but Penelope put her hand upon my
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. Don't listen to Dora&mdash;she always hated me. Listen to
      me. Penelope, you shall make me anything you choose; you would be the
      saving of me&mdash;that is, if you could put up with such a broken,
      sickly, ill-tempered wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Francis!&rdquo; and she just touched him with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught it and kept it. Then Penelope seemed to wake up as out of a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; she said hurriedly; &ldquo;you must not hold my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I, do not love you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so; he could not doubt it. The vainest man alive must, I think,
      have discerned at once that my sister spoke out of neither caprice or
      revenge, but in simple sadness of truth. Francis must have felt almost by
      instinct that, whether broken or not, the heart so long his, was his no
      longer&mdash;the love was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the mere knowledge of this made his own revive, or whether finding
      himself in the old familiar places&mdash;this walk was a favourite walk of
      theirs&mdash;the whole feeling returned in a measure, I cannot tell; I do
      not like to judge. But I am certain that, for the time, Francis suffered
      acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hate me then?&rdquo; said he at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; on the contrary, I feel very kindly towards you. There is nothing in
      the world I would not do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; perhaps you are right. I, a poor clerk, with neither health,
      nor income, nor prospects&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and no wonder, before the rebuke of my sister's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francis, you know you are not speaking as you think. You know I have
      given you my true reason, and my only one. If we were engaged still, in
      outward form, I should say exactly the same, for a broken promise is less
      wicked than a deceitful vow. One should not marry&mdash;one ought not&mdash;when
      one has ceased to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis made her no reply. The sense of all he had lost, now that he had
      lost it, seemed to come upon him heavily, overwhelmingly. His first words
      were the saddest and humblest I ever heard from Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve it all. No wonder you will never forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penelope smiled&mdash;a very mournful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your old habit of jumping at conclusions! Indeed, I have forgiven you
      long ago. Perhaps, had I been less faulty myself, I might have had more
      influence over you. But all was as it was to be, I suppose and it is over
      now. Do not let us revive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, and sat silent for a few moments, looking absently across the
      moorland; then with a sort of wistful tenderness&mdash;the tenderness
      which, one clearly saw, for ever prevents and excludes love&mdash;on
      Francis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not how it is, Francis, but you seem to me Francis no longer&mdash;quite
      another person. I cannot tell how the love has gone, but it is gone; as
      completely as if it had never existed. Sometimes I was afraid if I saw you
      it might come back again; but I have seen you, and it is not there. It
      never can return again any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, from henceforth, I am no more to you than any stranger in the
      street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that&mdash;it would not be true. Nothing you do, will ever
      be indifferent to me. If you do wrong&mdash;oh, Francis, it hurts me so!
      it will hurt me to the day of my death. I care little for your being very
      prosperous, or very happy, possibly no one is happy; but I want you to be
      good. We were young together, and I was very proud of you:&mdash;let me be
      proud of you again as we grow old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you will not marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for I do not love you; and never could again, no more than I could
      love another woman's husband. Francis,&rdquo; speaking almost in a whisper; &ldquo;you
      know as well as I do, that there is one person and only one, whom you
      ought to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrank back, and for the second time&mdash;the first being when I found
      him with his boy in his arms&mdash;Francis turned scarlet with honest
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you&mdash;is it Penelope Johnston who can say this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Penelope Johnston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it would be right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were long pauses between each of these questions, but my sister's
      answers were unhesitating. The grave decision of them seemed to smite home&mdash;home
      to the very heart of Francis Charteris. When his confusion and surprise
      abated, he stood with eyes cast down, deeply pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little soul!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;So fond of me, too&mdash;fond and
      faithful. She would be faithful to me to the end of my days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she would,&rdquo; answered Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here arose a piteous outcry of &ldquo;Daddy, Daddy!&rdquo; and little Franky, bursting
      from the cottage, came and threw himself in a perfect paroxysm of joy upon
      his father. Then I understood clearly how a good and religious woman like
      our Penelope could not possibly have continued loving, or thought of
      marrying, Francis Charteris, any more than if, as she said, he had been
      another woman's husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, pray don't take the child away. Let him remain with his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And from her tone, Francis himself must have felt&mdash;if further
      confirmation were needed&mdash;that now and henceforth Penelope Johnston
      could never view him in any other light than as Franky's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He submitted&mdash;it always was a relief to Francis to have things
      decided for him. Besides, he seemed really fond of the boy. To see how
      patiently he let Franky clamber up him, and finally mount on his shoulder,
      riding astride, and making a bridle of his hair, gave one a kindly
      feeling, nay, a sort of respect, for this poor sick man whom his child
      comforted; and who, however erring he had been, was now, nor was ashamed
      to be, a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't hate me, Franky,&rdquo; he said, with a sudden kiss upon the fondling
      face. &ldquo;You owe me no grudge, though you might, poor little scamp! You are
      not a bit ashamed of me; and, by God! (it was more a vow than an oath)
      I'll never be ashamed of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust in God you never will,&rdquo; said Penelope, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with that peculiar softness of voice, which I now notice
      whenever she speaks of or to children, she said a few words, the substance
      of which I remember Lisabel and myself quizzing her for, years ago,
      irritating her with the old joke about old bachelor's wives and old maids'
      children&mdash;namely, that those who are childless, and know they will
      die so, often see more clearly and feel more deeply, than parents
      themselves, the heavy responsibilities of parenthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she said this exactly, but you could read it in her eyes, as in a
      few simple words she praised Franky's beauty, hinted what a solemn thing
      it was to own such a son, and, if properly brought up, what a comfort he
      might grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis listened with a reverence that was beyond all love, and a humility
      touching to see. I, too, silently observing them both, could not help
      hearkening even with a sort of awe to every word that fell from the lips
      of my sister Penelope. All the while hearing, in a vague fashion, the last
      evening song of my lark, as he went up merrily into his cloud,&mdash;just
      as I have watched him, or rather his progenitors, numberless times; when,
      along this very road, I used to lag behind Francis and Penelope, wondering
      what on earth they were talking about, and how queer it was that they
      never noticed anything or anybody except one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigho! how times change!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sighing: I could not sigh, I did not. My heart was full, Max, but
      not with pain. For I am learning to understand what you often said, what I
      suppose we shall see clearly in the next life if not in this&mdash;that
      the only permanent pain on earth is sin. And, looking in my sister's dear
      face, I felt how blessed above all mere happiness, is the peace of those
      who have suffered and overcome suffering, who have been sinned against and
      have forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, when Franky, tired out, dropped suddenly asleep, as children
      do, his father and Penelope talked a good while, she inquiring, in her
      sensible, practical way, about his circumstances and prospects; he
      answering, candidly and apparently truthfully without any hesitation,
      anger, or pride; every now and then looking down, at the least movement of
      the pretty, sleepy face; while a soft expression, quite new in Francis
      Charteris, brightened his own. There was even a degree of cheerfulness and
      hope in his manner, as he said, in reply to some suggestion of my
      sister's:&mdash;&ldquo;Then you think, as Doctor Urquhart did, that my life is
      worth preserving&mdash;that I may turn out not such a bad man after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could a man be anything but a good man, who really felt what it is to
      be the father of a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francis replied nothing, but he held his little son closer to his breast.
      Who knows but that the pretty boy may be heaven's messenger to save the
      father's soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, Max, I still like, in my old moralizing habit, to &ldquo;justify the
      ways of God to men,&rdquo; to try and perceive the use of pain, the reason of
      punishment; and to feel, not only by faith, but experience, that, dark as
      are the ways of Infinite Mercy, they are all safe ways. &ldquo;<i>All things
      work together for good to them that love Him.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, watching these two, talking so quietly and friendly together, I
      thought how glad my Max would be; I remembered all my Max had done&mdash;Penelope
      knows it now; I told her that night. And, sad and anxious as I am about
      you and many things, there came over my heart one of those sudden sunshiny
      refts of peace, when we feel that whether or not all is happy, all is
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francis walked along by the pony-carriage for a quarter of a mile, or
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must turn now. This little man ought to have been in his bed an hour or
      more: he always used to be. His mother&mdash;&rdquo; Francis stopped&mdash;&ldquo;I
      beg your pardon.&rdquo; Then, hugging the boy in a sudden passion of remorse, he
      said, &ldquo;Penelope, if you want your revenge, take this. You cannot tell what
      a man feels, who, when the heyday of youth is gone, longs for a home, a
      virtuous home, yet knows that he never can offer or receive unblemished
      honour with his wife&mdash;never give his lawful name to his first-born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the sole allusion made openly to what both tacitly understood was
      to be, and which you, as well as we, will agree is the best thing that can
      be, under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I have to say to you, both from my sister and myself, that if
      Francis desires to make Lydia Cartwright his wife, and she is willing,
      tell them both that if she will come direct from the gaol to Rockmount, we
      will receive her kindly, provide everything suitable for her (since
      Francis must be very poor, and they will have to begin housekeeping on the
      humblest scale), and take care that she is married in comfort and credit.
      Also, say that former things shall never be remembered against her, but
      that she shall be treated henceforward with the respect due to Francis's
      wife; in some things, poor loving soul! a better wife than he deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he left us. Whether in this world he and Penelope will ever meet again,
      who knows? He seemed to have a foreboding that they never will, for, in
      parting, he asked, hesitatingly, if she would shake hands?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so, looking earnestly at him,&mdash;her first love, who, had he
      been true to himself and to her, might have been her love for ever. Then I
      saw her eye wander down to the little head which nestled on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kiss my boy, Penelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My sister leaned over, and touched Franky's forehead with her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless him! God bless you all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were her last words, and however long both may live, I have a
      conviction that they will be her last words&mdash;to Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the cottage; and through the rosy spring twilight, with a
      strangely solemn feeling, as if we were entering upon a new spring in
      another world, Penelope and I drove home.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Max, I have told you all about these. About myself&mdash;No, I'll
      not try to deceive you; God knows how true my heart is, and how sharp and
      sore is this pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Max, write to me;&mdash;if there is any trouble, I can bear it; any
      wrong&mdash;supposing Max could do me wrong&mdash;I'll forgive. I fear
      nothing, and nothing has power to grieve me, so long as you hold me fast,
      as I hold you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your faithful
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;A wonderful, wonderful thing&mdash;it only happened last night.
      It hardly feels real yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, last night, after I had done reading, papa mentioned your name of his
      own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, Penelope in asking his leave, as we thought it right to do before
      we sent that message to Lydia, had told him the whole story about your
      goodness to Francis. He then enquired abruptly how long it was since I had
      seen Doctor Urquhart?
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him, never since that day in the library&mdash;now a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do you expect to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; And all the bitterness of parting&mdash;the terrors lest
      life's infinite chances should make this parting perpetual&mdash;the
      murmurs that will rise, why hundreds and thousands who care little for one
      another should be always together, whilst we&mdash;we&mdash;Oh Max! it all
      broke out in a sob, &ldquo;Papa, papa, how <i>can</i> I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father looked at me as if he would read me through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good girl, and an honourable. He is honourable too. He would
      never persuade a child to disobey her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo;&mdash;and papa turned his head away, but he did say it, I
      could not mistake, &ldquo;tell Doctor Urquhart if he likes to come over to
      Rockmount, for one day only, I shall not see him, but you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max, come. Only for one day of holiday rest. It would do you good. There
      are green leaves in the garden, and sunshine and larks in the moorland,
      and&mdash;there is me. Come!

      CHAPTER X. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Theodora,
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not write, because I could not. In some states of mind nothing seems
      possible to a man but silence. Forgive me, my love, my comfort and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have suffered much, but it is over now, at least the suspense of it; and
      I can tell you all, with the calmness that I myself now feel. You are
      right; we love one another; we need not be afraid of any tribulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before entering on my affairs, let me answer your letter&mdash;all but its
      last word, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; My other self, my better conscience, will herself
      answer that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The substance of what you tell me, I already know. Francis Charteris came
      to me on Sunday week, and asked for Lydia. They were married two days
      after&mdash;I gave the bride away. Since then I have drank tea with them
      at his lodging, which, poor as it is, has already the cheerful comfort of
      a home with a woman in it, and that woman a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left them&mdash;Mr. Charteris sitting by the fire with his boy on his
      knee; he seems passionately fond of the little scapegrace, who is, as you
      said, his very picture. But more than once I caught his eyes following
      Lydia with a wistful, grateful tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most sensible practical girl imaginable,&rdquo; he said, during her
      momentary absence from the room; &ldquo;and she knows all my ways, and is so
      patient with them. 'A poor wench,' as Shakspere hath it. 'A poor wench,
      sir, but mine own!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For her, she busied herself about house-matters, humble and silent, except
      when her husband spoke to her, and then her whole face brightened. Poor
      Lydia! None familiar with her story are likely to see much of her again;
      Mr. Charteris seems to wish, and for very natural reasons, that they
      should begin the world entirely afresh; but we may fairly believe one
      thing concerning her as concerning another poor sinner,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Her
      sins, which were many, are forgiven, for she loved much</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I returned from them, I found your letter. It made me cease to feel
      what I have often felt of late, as if hope were knocking at every door
      except mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you once, never to be ashamed of showing me that you love me. Do
      not be; such love is a woman's glory, and a man's salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me now say what is to be said about myself, beginning at the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned to you once that I had here a good many enemies, but that I
      should soon live them down; which, for some time, I hoped and believed,
      and still believe that it would have been so, under ordinary
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have ever held that truth is stronger than falsehood, that an honest man
      has but to sit still, let the storm blow over, and bide his time. It does
      not shake this doctrine that things have fallen out differently with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time I had seen the cloud gathering; caught evil reports flying
      about; noticed that in society or in public meetings, now and then an
      acquaintance gave me the &ldquo;cold shoulder.&rdquo; Also, what troubled me more, for
      it was a hindrance felt daily, my influence and authority in the gaol did
      not seem quite what they used to be. I met no tangible affront, certainly,
      and all was tolerably smooth sailing, till I had to find fault, and then,
      as you know, a feather will show which way the wind blows!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new experience, for, at the worst of times, in camp or hospital,
      my poor fellows always loved me&mdash;I found it hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      More scurrilous newspaper paragraphs, the last and least obnoxious of
      which I sent you lest you might hear of it in some other way, followed
      those proceedings of mine concerning reformatories. Two articles&mdash;the
      titles, &ldquo;Physician, heal thyself,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Set a thief to catch a thief,&rdquo;
       will give you an idea of their tenor&mdash;went so far as to be actionable
      libels. Several persons here, our chaplain especially, urged me to take
      legal proceedings in defence of my character, but I declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, arguing the point, the chaplain pressed me for my reasons, which
      I gave him, and will give you, for I have since had only too much occasion
      to remember them literally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I had always had an instinctive dislike and dread of the law; that
      a man was good for little if he could not defend himself by any better
      weapons than the verdict of an ignorant jury, and a specious, sometimes
      lying, barrister's tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old clergyman, alarmed, &ldquo;hoped I was not a duellist,&rdquo; at which I only
      smiled. It never occurred to me to take the trouble of denying any such
      ridiculous purpose. I knew not how, when once the ball is set rolling
      against a man, his lightest words are made to gather weight and meaning,
      his very looks are brought in judgment upon him. It is the way of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see I can moralize, a sign that I am recovering myself; I think, with
      the relief of telling all out to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; reasoned the chaplain, &ldquo;when a man is innocent, why should he not
      declare it? Why sit tamely under calumny? It is unwise,&mdash;nay, unsafe.
      You are almost a stranger here, and we in the provinces like to find out
      everything about everybody. If I might suggest,&rdquo; and he apologized for
      what he called the friendly impertinence, &ldquo;why not be a little less
      modest, a little more free with your personal history, which must have a
      remarkable one, and let some friend, in a quiet, delicate way, see that
      the truth is as widely disseminated as the slander? If you will trust me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not choose a better pleader,&rdquo; said I, gratefully; &ldquo;but it is
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? A man like you can have nothing to dread&mdash;nothing to
      conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said again, all I could find words to say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He urged no more, but I soon felt painfully certain that some involuntary
      distrust lurked in the good man's mind, and though he continued the same
      to me in all our business relations, a cloud came over our private
      intercourse, which was never removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time another incident occurred; You know I have a little friend
      here, the governor's motherless daughter, a bonnie wee child whom I meet
      in the garden sometimes, where we water her flowers, and have long chats
      about birds, beasts, and the wonders of foreign parts. I even have given a
      present or two to this, my child-sweetheart. Are you jealous? She has your
      eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one day when I called Lucy, she came to me slowly, with a shy, sad
      countenance; and I found out after some pains, that her nurse had desired
      her not to play with Doctor Urquhart again, because he was &ldquo;naughty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Urquhart smilingly inquired what he had done?
    </p>
    <p>
      The child hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse does not exactly know, but she says it is something very wicked&mdash;as
      wicked as anything done by the bad people in here. But it isn't true&mdash;tell
      Lucy it isn't true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to put aside the little loving face, but I saw the nurse
      coming. Not an ill-meaning body, but one whom I knew for as arrant a
      gossip as any about this place. Her comments on myself troubled me little;
      I concluded it was but the result of that newspaper tattle, against which
      I was gradually growing hardened; nevertheless, I thought it best just to
      say that I had heard with much surprise what she had been telling Miss
      Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children and fools speak truth,&rdquo; said the woman saucily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be the more careful that children always hear the
      truth.&rdquo; And I insisted upon her repeating all the ridiculous tales she had
      been circulating about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, with difficulty, I got the facts out of her, they were not what I
      expected, but these: Somebody in the gaol had told somebody else how Dr.
      Urquhart had been in former days such an abandoned character, that still
      his evil conscience always drove him among criminals; made him haunt
      gaols, prisons, reformatories, and take an interest in every form of vice.
      Nay, people had heard me say&mdash;and truly they might!&mdash;<i>apropos</i>
      to a late hanging at Kirkdale&mdash;that I had sympathy even for a
      murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened&mdash;you will imagine how&mdash;to all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant I was overwhelmed; I felt as if God had forsaken me; as if
      His mercy were a delusion; His punishments never-ending; His justice never
      satisfied. Despite my promise to your father, I might, in some fatal way,
      have betrayed myself, even on the spot, had I not heard the little girl
      saying, with a sob, almost&mdash;poor pet!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, nurse! Doctor Urquhart isn't a wicked man; Lucy loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I remembered you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; I said, in a whisper, &ldquo;we are all wicked; but we may all be
      forgiven; I trust God has forgiven me;&rdquo; and I walked away without another
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since then I have thought it best to avoid the governor's garden; and
      it has cost me more pain than you would imagine&mdash;the contriving
      always to pass at a distance, so as to get only a nod and smile, which
      cannot harm her, from little Lucy.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time&mdash;it might be two or three days after, for out of
      work-hours I little noticed how time passed&mdash;an unpleasant
      circumstance occurred with Lucy's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have told you of him; for he is a remarkable man&mdash;young still,
      and well-looking; with manners like his features, hard as iron, though
      delicate and polished as steel. He seems born to be the ruler of
      criminals. Brutality, meanness, or injustice would be impossible to him.
      Likewise, another thing&mdash;mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this point that he and I had our difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      We met in the east ward, when he pointed out to me, in passing, the
      announcement on the centre slate of &ldquo;a boy to be whipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems ridiculous, but the words sickened me. For I knew the boy, knew
      also his offence; and that such a punishment would be the first step
      towards converting a mere headstrong lad, sent here for a street row,
      into, a hardened ruffian. I pleaded for him strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor listened&mdash;polite, but inflexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on speaking with unusual warmth; you know my horror of these
      floggings; you know, too, my opinion on the system of punishment, viewed
      as mere punishment, with no ulterior aim at reformation. I believe it is
      only our blinded human interpretation of things spiritual, which
      transforms the immutable law that evil is its own avenger and that the
      wrath of God against sin must be as everlasting as His pity for sinners&mdash;into
      the doctrine of eternal torment, the worm that dieth not, and the fire
      that is never quenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor heard all I had to say; then, politely always, regretted that
      it was impossible either to grant my request, or release me from my duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, however, one course which I may suggest to Doctor Urquhart,
      considering his very peculiar opinions, and his known sympathy with
      criminals. Do you not think, it might be more agreeable to you to resign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were nothing; but as he fixed on me that keen eye, which, he
      boasts can, without need of judge or jury detect a man's guilt or
      innocence, I felt convinced that with him too my good name was gone. It
      was no longer a battle with mere side-winds of slander&mdash;the storm had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might have sunk like a coward, if there were only myself to be crushed
      under it. As it was, I looked the governor in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any special motive for this suggestion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have stated it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then allow me to state, that whatever my opinions may be, so long as my
      services are useful here, I have not the slightest wish or intention of
      resigning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was flogged. I said to him, &ldquo;Bear it; better confess,&rdquo;&mdash;as he
      had done&mdash;&ldquo;confess and be punished now. It will then be over.&rdquo; And I
      hope, by the grateful look of the poor young wretch, that with the pain,
      the punishment was over; that my pity helped him to endure it, so that it
      did not harden him, but, with a little help, he may become an honest lad
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left him in his cell, I rather envied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now became necessary to look to my own affairs, and discover if
      possible, all that report alleged against me&mdash;false or true&mdash;as
      well as the originator of these statements. Him I at last by the merest
      chance discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      My little lady, with her quick, warm feelings, must learn to forgive, as I
      have long ago forgiven. It was Mr. Francis Charteris.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe still, it was less from malice premeditated, than from a mere
      propensity for talking, and that looseness and inaccuracy of speech which
      he always had&mdash;that he, when idling away his time in the debtor's
      ward of this gaol, repeated, probably with extempore additions, what your
      sister Penelope once mentioned to him concerning me&mdash;namely, that I
      was once about to be married, when the lady's father discovered a crime I
      had committed in my youth&mdash;whether dishonesty, duelling, seduction,
      or what, he could not say&mdash;but it was something absolutely
      unpardonable by an honourable man, and the marriage was forbidden. On
      this, all the reports against me had been grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      After hearing this story, which one of the turnkeys whose children were
      down with fever, told me while watching by their bedside, begging my
      pardon for doing it, honest man! I went and took a long walk down the
      Waterloo shore, to calm myself, and consider my position. For I knew it
      was in vain to struggle any more. I was ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      An innocent man might have fought on; how any one, with a clear
      conscience, is ever conquered by slander, or afraid of it, I cannot
      understand. With a clean heart, and truth on his tongue, a man ought to be
      as bold as a lion. I should have been; but&mdash;My love, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Waterloo shore has always been a favourite haunt of mine. You once
      said, you should like to live by the sea; and I have never heard the
      ripple of the tide without thinking of you&mdash;never seen the little
      children playing about and digging on the sands without thinking&mdash;God
      help me! if one keeps silence, it is not because one does not feel the
      knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who would have thought the old man had so much blood in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Let me stop. I will not pain you, my love, more than I can help. Besides,
      as I told you, the worst of my suffering is ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe I must have sat till night-fall among the sand-hills by the
      shore. For years to come, if I live so long, I shall see as clear and also
      as unreal as a painting&mdash;that level sea-line, along which moved the
      small white silent ships, and the steamers, with their humming
      paddle-wheels and their trailing thread of smoke, dropping one after the
      other into what some one of your favourite poets, my child, calls &ldquo;the
      under world.&rdquo; There seemed a great weight on my head&mdash;a weariness all
      over me. I did not feel anything much, after the first half-hour; except a
      longing to see your little face once again, and then, if it were God's
      will, to lie down and die, somewhere near you, quietly, giving no trouble
      to you or to any one any more. You will remember, I was not in my usual
      health, and had had extra hard work, for some little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my dear one, this is enough about myself, that day. I went home and
      fell into harness as usual; there was nothing to be done but to wait till
      the storm burst, and I wished for many reasons to retain my situation at
      the gaol as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a difficult time; rising to each day's duty, with total
      uncertainty of what might happen before night: and, duty done, struggling
      against a depression such as I have not known for these many years. In the
      midst of it came your dear letters&mdash;cheerful, loving, contented&mdash;unwontedly
      contented they seemed to me. I could not answer them, for to have written
      in a false strain was impossible, and to tell you everything seemed
      equally so. I said to myself, &ldquo;No, poor child! she will learn all soon
      enough. Let her be happy while she can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was wrong; I was unjust to you and to myself. From the hour you gave me
      your love, I owed it to us both to give you my full confidence, as much as
      if you were my wife. I had no right to wound your dear heart by keeping
      back from it any sorrows of mine. Forgive me, and forgive something else,
      which, I now see, was crueller still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora, I wished many times that you were free; that I had never bound
      you to my hard lot, but kept silence and left you to forget me, to love
      some one else better than me&mdash;pardon, pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      For I was once actually on the point of writing to you, saying this, when
      I remembered something you had said long ago,&mdash;that whether or no we
      were ever married you were glad we had been betrothed&mdash;that so far we
      might always be a help and comfort to one another. For, you added, when I
      was blaming myself, and talking as men do of &ldquo;honour,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pride&rdquo;&mdash;to
      have left you free when you were not free, would have given you all the
      cares of love, with neither its rights, nor duties, nor sweetnesses; and
      this might&mdash;you did not say it would&mdash;but it might have broken
      your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      So in my bitter strait I trusted that pure heart, whose instinct, I felt,
      was truer than all my wisdom. I did not write the letter, but at the same
      time, as I have told you, it was impossible to write any other, even a
      single line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your last letter came. Happily, it reached me the very morning when the
      crisis which I had been for weeks expecting, occurred. I had it in my
      pocket all the time I stood in that room before those men,&mdash;but I had
      best relate from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are aware that any complaints respecting the officers of this gaol, or
      questions concerning its internal management, are laid before the visiting
      justices. Thus, after the governor's hint, on every board day, I prepared
      myself for a summons. At length it came; ostensibly for a very trivial
      matter&mdash;some relaxation of discipline which I had ordered and been
      counteracted in. But my conduct had never been called into question
      before, and I knew what it implied. The very form of it&mdash;&ldquo;The
      governor's compliments, and he requests Doctor Urquhart's attendance in
      the board-room;&rdquo;&mdash;instead of &ldquo;Doctor, come up to my room and talk the
      matter over,&rdquo; was sufficient indication of what was impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found present, besides the governor and chaplain, an unusual number of
      magistrates. These, who are not always or necessarily gentlemen, stared at
      me as if I had been some strange beast, all the time I was giving my brief
      evidence about the breach of regulations complained of. It was soon
      settled, for I had been careful to keep within the letter of the law, and
      I made a motion to take leave, when one of the justices requested me to
      &ldquo;wait a bit, they hadn't done with me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These sort of men, low-born&mdash;not that that is any disgrace, but a
      glory, unless accompanied with a low nature&mdash;and &ldquo;dressed in a little
      brief authority,&rdquo; one often meets with here; I was well used to deal with,
      them, and to their dealings with the like of me&mdash;a poor professional,
      whose annual income was little more than they would expend, carelessly,
      upon one of their splendid &ldquo;feeds.&rdquo; But, until lately, among my co-mates
      in office, I had been both friendly and popular. Now, they took their tone
      from the rest, and even the governor and-the chaplain preserved towards me
      a rigid silence. You do not know our old mess phrase of being &ldquo;sent to
      Coventry.&rdquo; If you did, you would understand how those ten minutes that,
      according to my orders, I sat aloof from the board, while other business
      was proceeding, were not the pleasantest possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men amongst men grow hard, are liable to evil passions, fits of pride,
      hatred, and revenge, that are probably unfamiliar to you sweet women. It
      was well I had your letter in my pocket. Besides, there is something in
      coming to the crisis of a great misfortune which braces up a man's nerves
      to meet it. So, when the governor, turning round in his always courteous
      tone, said the board requested a few minutes' conversation with me, I
      could rise and stand steady, to meet whatever shape of hard fortune lay
      before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor, like most men of non-intrusive but iron will, who have both
      temper and feelings perfectly under control, has a very strong influence
      wherever he goes. It was he who opened and carried on with me, what he
      politely termed, a &ldquo;little conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These difficulties,&rdquo; continued he, after referring to the dismissed
      complaint of my straining the rules of the gaol to their utmost limit,
      from my &ldquo;sympathy with criminals,&rdquo; &ldquo;these unpleasantnesses, Doctor
      Urquhart, will, I fear, be always occurring. Have you reconsidered the
      hint I gave to you, some little time ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered that it was rarely my habit to take hints; I preferred having
      all things spoken right out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such candour is creditable, though not always possible or advisable. I
      should have been exceedingly glad if you had saved me from what I feel to
      be my duty, however painful, namely, to repeat my private suggestion
      publicly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I should tender my resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my saying&mdash;and the board agrees with me&mdash;that such a
      step seems desirable, for many reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited, and then asked for those reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart must surely be aware of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man is not bound to rush madly into his ruin. I determined to die
      fighting, at any rate. I said, addressing the board:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am not aware of having conducted myself in any manner that
      unfits me for being surgeon to this gaol. Any slight differences between
      the governor and myself, are mere matters of opinion, which signify
      little, so long as neither trenches on the other's authority, and both are
      amenable to the regulations of the establishment. If you have any cause of
      complaint against me, state it, reprove or dismiss me, it is your right;
      but no one has a right without just grounds to request me to resign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor, even through that handsome, impassive, masked countenance of
      his, looked annoyed. For an instant his hard manner dropped into the old
      friendliness, even as when, in the first few weeks after his wife's death,
      he and I used to sit playing chess together of evenings, with little Lucy
      between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, why will you misapprehend me? It is for your own sake that I
      wish, before the matter is opened up further, you should resign your
      post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's consideration, I requested him to explain himself more
      clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the magistrates here cried out with a laugh:&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come,
      doctor, no shamming. You are the town's talk.&rdquo; And another suggested that
      &ldquo;Brown had better mind his P's and Q's; there were such things as actions
      for libel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I replied if the gentlemen referred to the scurrilous allegations against
      me which had appeared in print, they might speak without fear; I had no
      intention of prosecuting for libel. This silenced them a moment, and then
      the first magistrate said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give a dog a bad name and hang him; but surely, doctor, you can't be
      aware what a very bad name you have somehow got in these parts, or you
      would have been more eager to draw your neck out of the halter in time.
      Why, bless my soul, man alive, do you know what folk make you out to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This discussion is growing foreign to the matter in hand,&rdquo; interrupted
      the governor, who I felt had never taken his sharp eyes off me. &ldquo;The
      question is merely this: that any officer in authority among criminals
      must of necessity bear an unblemished character. Neither in the
      establishment nor out of it ought people to be able to say of him that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it out, sir.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That there were circumstances in his former life
      which would not bear inspection, and that merely accident drew the line
      between himself and the convicts he was bent on reforming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said a justice, who had long thwarted me in my schemes;
      having a conscientious objection to reforming everybody&mdash;including
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;I did not give this as a fact,&mdash;only a
      report. These reports have come to such a height, that they must either be
      proved or denied. And therefore I wished, before any public inquiry became
      necessary&mdash;unless, indeed, Doctor Urquhart will consent to the
      explanatory self-defence which he definitely refused Mr. Thorley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they both looked anxiously at me&mdash;these two whom I have always
      found honest, honorable men, and who were once my friends, or at least
      friendly associates&mdash;the chaplain and the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora, no one need ever dread lest the doctrine of total forgiveness
      should make guilt no burthen, and repentance pleasant and easy. There are
      some consequences of sin which must haunt a sinner to the day of his
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been one minute or ten, that I stood motionless, feeling as
      if I could have given up life and all its blessings without a pang, to be
      able to face those men with a clear conscience, and say, &ldquo;It is all a lie.
      I am innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for my salvation, came the thought&mdash;it seemed spoken into my
      ear, the voice half like Dallas's, half like yours&mdash;&ldquo;If God hath
      forgiven thee, why be afraid of men?&rdquo; And I said, humbly enough&mdash;yet,
      I trust, without any cringing or abjectness of fear&mdash;that I wished,
      before taking any further step, to hear the whole of the statements
      current against myself, and how far they were credited by the gentlemen
      before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accusation, I was informed, stood thus: floating rumours having
      accumulated into a substantive form&mdash;terribly near the truth! that I
      had, in my youth, either here or abroad, committed some crime which
      rendered me amenable to the laws of my country; and though, by some trick
      of law, I had escaped justice, the ban upon me was such, that only by the
      wandering life which I myself had owned to having led, could I escape the
      fury of public opinion. The impression against me was now so strong, in
      the gaol and out of it, that the governor would not engage even by his own
      authority to preserve mine unless I furnished him with an immediate,
      explicit denial to this charge. Which, he was pleased to say, if it had
      not been so widely spread, so mysterious in its origin, and so oddly
      corroborated by accidental admissions on my part, he should have treated
      as simply ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, apparently re-assured by the composure with which I
      had listened, &ldquo;I have only to ask you to deny it, point-blank, before the
      board and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked, what must I deny?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if the accusations were not too ludicrous to express, just state
      that you are neither forger, burglar, nor body-snatcher; that you never
      either killed a man (unprofessionally, of course, if we may be excused the
      joke)&mdash;for professional purposes, or shot him irregularly in a duel,
      or waylaid him with pistols behind a hedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I supposed to have committed all these crimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is the gullibility of the public; you really are,&rdquo; said the
      governor, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the indignant impulse of the moment, I denied them each and all, upon
      my honor as a gentleman; until, feeling the old chaplain cordially grip my
      hand, I was roused into a full consciousness of where and what I was, and
      what, either by word or implication, I had been asserting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody said, &ldquo;Give him air; no wonder he feels it, poor fellow!&rdquo; And so,
      after a little, I gathered up my faculties, and saw the board sitting
      waiting; and the governor with pen and ink before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This painful business will soon be settled, Doctor,&rdquo; said he cheerfully.
      &ldquo;Just answer a question or two, which, as a matter of form, I will put in
      writing, and then, if you will do me the honour to dine with me to-day, we
      can consult how best to make the statement public; without of course
      compromising your dignity. To begin. You hereby make declaration that you
      were never in gaol? never tried at any assizes? have never committed any
      act which rendered you liable to prosecution under our criminal law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran the words off carelessly, and paused for my answer. When none came,
      he looked up, his own penetrative, suspicious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I did not express myself clearly?&rdquo; And he slightly changed the
      form of the sentence. &ldquo;Now, what shall I write, Doctor Urquhart?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could then and there have made full confession, and gone out of that
      room an arrested prisoner, it would have been, so far as regarded myself,
      a relief unutterable, a mercy beyond all mercies. But I had to remember
      your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor laid down his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This looks, to say the least, rather strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; cried one of the board, &ldquo;you must be mad to hold your tongue and
      let your character go to the dogs in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas, I was not mad; I saw all that was vanishing from me&mdash;inevitably,
      irredeemably&mdash;my good name, my chance of earning a livelihood, my
      sweet hope of a home and a wife. And I might save everything, and keep my
      promise to your father also, by just one little lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you have had me utter it? No, love; I know you would rather have had
      me die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensation was like dying, for one minute, and then it passed away. I
      looked steadily at my accusers; for accusation, at all events strong
      suspicion, was in every countenance now; and told them that though I had
      not perpetrated a single one of the atrocious crimes laid to my charge,
      still the events of my life had been peculiar; and circumstances left me
      no option but the course I had hitherto pursued, namely, total silence.
      That if my good character were strong enough to sustain me through it, I
      would willingly retain my post at the gaol, and weather the storm as I
      best could. If this course were impossible&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said the governor, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have no alternative but to tender my resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was accepted at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out from the board-room a disgraced man, with a stain upon my
      character which will last for life, and follow me wherever I plant my
      foot. The honest Urquhart name, which my father bore, and Dallas&mdash;which
      I ought to have given stainless to my wife, and left&mdash;if I could
      leave nothing else&mdash;to my children&mdash;ay, it was gone. Gone, for
      ever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stole up into my own rooms, and laid myself down on my bed, as
      motionless as if it had been my coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear not, my love; one sin was saved me, perhaps by your letter of that
      morning. The wretchedest, most hopeless, most guilty of men would never
      dare to pray for death so long as he knew that a good woman loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When daylight failed, I bestirred myself, lit my lamp, and began to make a
      few preparations and arrangements about my rooms&mdash;it being clear
      that, wherever I went, I must quit this place as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mind was almost made up as to the course I ought to pursue; and that of
      itself calmed me. I was soon able to sit down, and begin this letter to
      you; but got no further than the first three words, which, often as I have
      written them, look as new, strange, and precious as ever: &ldquo;<i>My dear
      Theodora</i>.&rdquo; Dear,&mdash;God knows how infinitely! and mine&mdash;altogether
      and everlastingly mine. I felt this, even now. In the resolution I had
      made, no doubts shook me with respect to you; for you would bid me to do
      exactly what conscience urged&mdash;ay, even if you differed from me. You
      said once, with your arms round my neck, and your sweet eyes looking up
      steadfastly in mine:&mdash;&ldquo;Max, whatever happens, always do what you
      think to be right, without reference to me. I would love you all the
      better for doing it, even if you broke my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was pondering thus, planning how best to tell you of things so sore;
      when there came a knock to my room-door. Expecting no one but a servant, I
      said &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and did not even look up&mdash;for every creature in the
      gaol must be familiar with my disgrace by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart, do I intrude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodora, if I have ever in my letters implied a word against him&mdash;for
      the narrowness and formality of his religious belief sometimes annoyed and
      were a hindrance to me&mdash;remember it not. Set down his name, the
      Reverend James Thorley, on the list of those whom I wish to be kept always
      in your tender memory, as those whom I sincerely honoured, and who have
      been most kind to me of all my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man spoke with great hesitation, and when I thanked him for
      coming, replied in the manner which I had many a time heard him use in
      convict cells:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came, sir,' because I felt it to be my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thorley, whatever was your motive, I respect it, and thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we remained silent&mdash;both standing&mdash;for he declined my offer
      of a chair. Noticing my preparations, he said, with some agitation, &ldquo;Am I
      hindering your plans for departure? Are you afraid of the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed relieved; then, after a long examining look at me, quite broke
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Doctor, Doctor, what a terrible thing this is! who would have believed
      it of you!&rdquo; It was very bitter, Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that I attempted neither answer nor defence, the chaplain
      continued sternly:&mdash;&ldquo;I come here, sir, not to pry into your secrets,
      but to fulfil my duty as a minister of God; to urge you to make
      confession, not unto me, but unto Him whom you have offended, whose eye
      you cannot escape, and whose justice sooner or later will bring you to
      punishment. But perhaps,&rdquo; seeing I bore with composure these and many
      similar arguments; alas, they were only too familiar! &ldquo;perhaps I am
      labouring under a strange mistake? You do not look guilty, and I could as
      soon have believed in my own son's being a criminal, as you. For God's
      sake break this reserve, and tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, and then the old man said, sighing:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will urge no more. Your sin, whatever it be, rests between you
      and the Judge of sinners. You say the law has no hold over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I was not afraid of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, it must have been a moral, rather than a legal crime, if crime
      it was.&rdquo; And again I had to bear that searching look, so dreadful because
      it was so eager and kind. &ldquo;On my soul, Doctor Urquhart, I believe you to
      be entirely innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I cried out, and stopped; then asked him &ldquo;if he did not believe it
      possible for a man to have sinned and yet repented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorley started back&mdash;so greatly shocked that I perceived at once
      what an implication I had made. But it was too late now; nor, perhaps,
      would I have had it otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a clergyman&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;If a man sin a sin
      which is not unto death,&mdash;You know the rest. And there is a sin which
      is unto death; I do not say that he shall pray for it? But never that we
      shall <i>not</i> pray for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And falling down on his knees beside me, the old chaplain repeated in a
      broken voice:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Remember not the sins of my youth nor my
      transgressions; according to thy mercy, think thou upon me, O Lord, for
      thy goodness.</i>' Not ours, which is but filthy rags; for <i>Thy</i>
      goodness, through Jesus Christ, O Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thorley rose, took the chair I gave him, and we sat silent. Presently
      he asked me if I had any plans? Had I considered what exceeding difficulty
      I should find in establishing myself anywhere professionally, after what
      had happened this day?
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, I was fully aware that, so far as my future prospects were
      concerned, I was a ruined man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you take it so calmly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said he, after again watching me, &ldquo;you must either be innocent,
      or your error must have been caused by strong temptation, and long ago
      retrieved. I will never believe but that you are now as honourable and
      worthy a man as any living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An uncontrollable weakness came over me; Mr. Thorley, too, was much
      affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what it is, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, as he wrung my hand,
      &ldquo;you must start afresh in some other part of the world. You are no older
      than my son-in-law was when he married and went to Canada, in your own
      profession too. By the way, I have an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea was worthy of this excellent man, and of his behaviour to me. He
      explained that his son-in-law, a physician in good practice, wanted a
      partner&mdash;some one from the old country, if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you went out, with an introduction from me, he would be sure to like
      you, and all might be settled in no time. Besides, you Scotch hang
      together so&mdash;my son-in-law is a Fife man&mdash;and did you not say
      you were born or educated at St. Andrews? The very thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he urged me to start by next Saturday's American mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp straggle went on within my mind. Mr. Thorley evidently thought it
      sprang from another cause, and, with much delicacy, gave me to understand
      that in the promised introduction, he did not consider there was the
      slightest necessity to state more than that I had been an army surgeon,
      and was his valued friend; that no reports against me were likely to reach
      the far Canadian settlement, whither I should carry both to his son-in-law
      and the world at large, a perfectly unknown and unblemished name.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had ever wavered, this decided me. The hope must go. So I let it go,
      in all probability, for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was I right? I can hear you say, &ldquo;Yes, Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In bidding the chaplain farewell, I tried to explain to him, that in this
      generous offer he had given to me more than he guessed&mdash;faith not
      only in heaven, but in mankind, and strength to do without shrinking what
      I am bound to do&mdash;trusting that there are other good Christians in
      this world besides himself who dare believe that a man may sin and yet
      repent&mdash;that the stigma even of an absolute crime is not hopeless,
      nor eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own opinion concerning my present conduct, or the facts of my past
      history, I did not seek; it was of little moment; he will shortly learn
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, I have resolved, as the only thing possible to my future peace,
      the one thing exacted by the laws of God and man&mdash;to do what I ought
      to have done twenty years ago&mdash;to deliver myself up to justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have told you; but I cannot tell you the infinite calm which this
      resolution has brought to me. To be free; to lay down this living load of
      lies, which has hung about me for twenty years; to speak the whole truth
      before God and man&mdash;confess all, and take my punishment&mdash;my
      love, my love, if you knew what the thought of this is to me, you would
      neither tremble nor weep, but rather rejoice!
    </p>
    <p>
      My Theodora, I take you in my arms, I hold you to my heart, and love you
      with a love that is dearer than life and stronger than-death, and I ask
      you to let me do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the enclosed letter to your father, I have, after relating all the
      circumstances of which I here inform you, implored him to release me from
      a pledge which I ought never to have given. Never, for it was putting the
      fear of man before the fear of God: it was binding myself to an eternal
      hypocrisy, an inward gnawing of shame, which paralyzed my very soul. I
      must escape it; you must try to release me from it,&mdash;my love, who
      loves me better than herself, better than myself, I mean this poor
      worthless self, battered and old, which I have often thought was more fit
      to go down into the grave than live to be my dear girl's husband. Forgive
      me if I wound you. By the intolerable agony of this hour, I feel that the
      sacrifice is just and right.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must help me, you must urge your father to set me free. Tell him&mdash;indeed
      I have told him&mdash;that he need dread no disgrace to the family, or to
      him who is no more. I shall state nothing of Henry Johnston excepting his
      name, and my own confession will be sufficient and sole evidence against
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the possible result of my trial, I have not overlooked it. It was
      just, if only for my dear love's sake, that I should gain some idea of the
      chances against me. Little as I understand of the law, and especially
      English law, it seems to me very unlikely that the verdict will be wilful
      murder, nor shall I plead, guilty to that. God and my own conscience are
      witness that I did <i>not</i> commit murder, but unpremeditated
      manslaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punishment for this is, I believe, sometimes transportation, sometimes
      imprisonment for a long term of years. If it were death&mdash;which
      perhaps it might as well be to a man of my age, I must face it. The
      remainder of my days, be they few or many, must be spent in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do not hear within two days' post from Rockmount, I shall conclude
      your father makes no opposition to my determination, and go at once to
      surrender myself at Salisbury. <i>You</i> need not write; it might
      compromise you; it would be almost a relief to me to hear nothing of or
      from you, until all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now farewell. My personal effects here I leave in charge of the
      chaplain, with a sealed envelope, containing the name and address of the
      friend to whom they are to be sent in case of my death, or any other
      emergency. This is yourself. In my will, I have given you, as near as the
      law allows, every right that you would have had, as my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife&mdash;my wife in the sight of God, farewell! That is, until such
      time as I dare write again. Take good care of yourself&mdash;be patient
      and have hope. In whatever he commands&mdash;he is too just a man to
      command an injustice&mdash;obey your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forget me not&mdash;but you never will. If I could have seen you once
      more, have felt you close to my heart&mdash;but perhaps it is better as it
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a week's suspense for you, and it will be over. Let us trust in God;
      and farewell! Remember how I loved you, my child!
    </p>

      CHAPTER XI. HIS STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y dear Theodora,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time you will have known all.&mdash;Thank God, it is over. My
      dear, dear love&mdash;my own faithful girl&mdash;it is over!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was brought back to prison tonight, I found your letters; but I had
      heard of you the day before, from Colin Granton. Do not regret the chance
      which made Mr. Johnston detain my letter to you, instead of forwarding it
      at once to the Cedars. These sort of things never seem to me as
      accidental; all was for good. In any case, I could not have done otherwise
      than I did; but it would have been painful to have done it in direct
      opposition to your father. The only thing I regret is, that my poor child
      should have had the shock of first seeing these hard tidings of my
      surrender to the magistrate, and my public confession, in a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granton told me how you bore it. Tell him, I shall remember gratefully all
      my life, his goodness to you, and his leaving his young wife&mdash;(whom
      he dearly loves, I can see) to come to me, here. Nor was he my only
      friend; do not think I was either contemned or forsaken. Sir William
      Treherne and several others offered any amount of, bail for me; but it was
      better I should remain in prison, during the few days between my committal
      and the assizes. I needed quiet and solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, my love, I dared not have seen you, even had you immediately
      come to me. You have acted in all things as my dear girl was sure to act,
      wise, thoughtful, self-controlled, and oh! how infinitely loving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to stop here for want of daylight&mdash;but they have now brought me
      my allowance of candle&mdash;slender enough, so I must make haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you to have this full account as soon as possible after the brief
      telegram which I know Mr. Granton sent you, the instant my trial was over.
      A trial, however, it was not&mdash;in my ignorance of law, I imagined much
      that never happened. What did happen, I will here set down.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not expect me to give many details; my head was rather confused,
      and my health has been a good deal shaken, though do not take heed of
      anything Granton may tell you about me or my looks. I shall recover now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the four days of imprisonment gave me time to recover myself
      in a measure, and I was able to write out the statement I meant to read at
      my trial. I preferred reading it, lest any physical weakness might make me
      confused or inaccurate. You see I took all rational precautions for my own
      safety. I was as just to myself as I would have been to another man. This
      for your sake, and also for the sake of those now dead, upon whose fair
      name I have brought the first blot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must not think of that&mdash;it is too late. What best becomes me is
      humility, and gratitude to God and man. Had I known in my wretched youth,
      when, absorbed in terror of human justice, I forgot justice divine, had I
      but known there were so many merciful hearts in this world!
    </p>
    <p>
      After Colin Granton left me last night, I slept quietly, for I felt quiet
      and at rest. O the peace of an unburdened conscience, the freedom of a
      soul at ease&mdash;which, the whole truth being told, has no longer
      anything to dread, and is prepared for everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose calm and refreshed, and could see through my cell-window that it
      was a lovely spring morning. I was glad my Theodora did not know what
      particular day of the assizes was fixed for my trial. It would make things
      a little easier for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was noon before the case came on: a long time to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not suppose me braver than I was. When I found myself standing in the
      prisoner's dock, the whole mass of staring faces seemed to whirl round and
      round before my eyes; I felt sick and cold; I had lost more strength than
      I thought. Everything present melted away into a sort of dream through
      which I fancied I heard you speaking, but could not distinguish any words;
      except these, the soft, still tenderness of which haunted me as freshly as
      if they had been only just uttered: &ldquo;My dear Max! my dear Max!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this I perceived that my mind was wandering, and must be recalled; so I
      forced myself to look round at the judge, jury, witness-box&mdash;in the
      which was one person sitting with his white head resting on his hand. I
      felt who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you know your father was subpoenaed here? If so, what a day this must
      have been for my poor child! Think not, though, that the sight of him
      added to my suffering. I had no fear of him or of anything now. Even
      public shame was less terrible than I thought; those scores of inquisitive
      eyes hardly stabbed so deep as in days past did many a kind look of your
      father's, many a loving glance of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formalities of the court began, but I scarcely listened to them. They
      seemed to me of little consequence. As I said to Granton when he urged me
      to employ counsel, a man who only wants to speak the truth can surely
      manage to do it, in spite of the incumbrances of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to an end&mdash;the long, unintelligible indictment&mdash;and my
      first clear perception of my position was the judge's question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How say you, prisoner at the bar, guilty, or not guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pleaded &ldquo;guilty,&rdquo; as a matter of course. The judge asked several
      questions, and held a long discussion with the counsel for the crown, on
      what he termed &ldquo;this very remarkable case,&rdquo; the purport of it was, I
      believe, to ascertain my sanity; and whether any corroboration of my
      confession could be obtained. It could not. All possible witnesses were
      long since dead, except your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still kept his position, neither turning towards me, nor yet from me,&mdash;neither
      compassionate nor revengeful, but sternly composed; as if his long sorrows
      had obtained their solemn satisfaction, and even though the end was thus,
      he felt relieved that it had come. As if he, like me, had learned to
      submit that our course should be shaped for us rather than by us; being
      taught that even in this world's events, the God of Truth will be
      justified before men; will prove that: those who, under any pretence,
      disguise or deny the truth, live not unto Him, but unto the father of
      lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not strange, that then and there I should have been calm enough to
      think of these things. Ay, and should calmly write of them now. But as I
      have told you, in a great crisis my mind always recovers its balance and
      becomes quiet. Besides, sickness makes us both clear-sighted and
      far-sighted; wonderfully so, sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not suppose from this admission, that my health is gone or going; but,
      simply that I am, as I see in the looking-glass, a somewhat older and
      feebler man than my dear love remembers me a year ago. But I must hasten
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plea of guilty being recorded, no trial was necessary; the judge had
      only to pass sentence. I was asked whether, by counsel or otherwise, I
      wished to say anything in my own defence? And then I rose and told the
      whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not grieve for me, Theodora? The truth is never really terrible. What
      makes it so is the fear of man, and that was over with me; the torment of
      guilty shame, and that was gone too. I have had many a moment of far
      sharper anguish, more grinding humiliation than this, when I stood up and
      publicly confessed the sin of my youth, with the years of suffering which
      had followed&mdash;dare I say expiated it?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a sense in which no sin ever can be expiated, except in One
      Blessed Way;&mdash;yet, in so far as man can atone to man, I believed I
      had atoned for mine; I had tried to give a life for a life, morally
      speaking; nay, I had given it. But it was not enough; it could not he.
      Nothing less than the truth was required from me&mdash;and I here offered
      it. Thus, in one short half hour, the burthen of a lifetime was laid down
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge&mdash;he was not unmoved,-so they told me afterwards&mdash;said
      he must take time to consider the sentence. Had the prisoner any witnesses
      as to character?
    </p>
    <p>
      Several came forward. Among the rest, the good old chaplain, who had
      travelled all night from Liverpool, in order, he said, just to shake hands
      with me to-day&mdash;which he did, in open court&mdash;God bless him!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also Colonel Turton; with Colin Granton&mdash;who had never left
      me since daylight this morning&mdash;but they all held back when they saw
      rise and come forward, as if with the intention of being sworn, your
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have no fear my love, for his health. I watched him closely all this day.
      He bore it well&mdash;it will have no ill result I feel sure. From my
      observation of him, I should say that a great and salutary change had come
      over him, both body and mind, and that he is as likely to enjoy a green
      old age as any one I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke, his voice was as steady and clear as before his accident it
      used to be in the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lords and gentlemen, I was subpoenaed to this trial. Not being called
      upon to give evidence, I wish to make a statement upon oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There must have been a &ldquo;sensation in the court,&rdquo; as newspapers say, for I
      saw Granton look anxiously at me. But I had no fears. Your father,
      whatever he had to say, was sure to speak the truth, not a syllable more
      or less, and the truth was all I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge here interfered, observing that there being no trial, he could
      receive no legal evidence against the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor have I any such evidence to give: I wish only for justice. My lord,
      may I speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assent was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your father's words were brief and formal; but you will imagine how they
      fell on one ear at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is William Henry Johnston, clerk, of Rockmount, Surrey. Henry
      Johnston, who&mdash;died&mdash;on the night of November 19th, 1836, was my
      only son. I know the prisoner at the bar. I knew him for some time before
      he was aware whose father I was, or I had any suspicion that my son came
      to his death in any other way than by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your first discovery of these painful facts by the prisoner's present
      confession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo; Your father hesitated, but only momentarily. &ldquo;He told me
      the whole story, himself, a year ago, under circumstances that would have
      induced most men to conceal it for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge inquired why was not this confession made public at once?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was afraid. I did not wish to make my family history a by-word
      and a scandal. I exacted a promise that the secret should be kept
      inviolate. This promise he has broken&mdash;but I blame him not. It ought
      never to have been made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. It was thwarting the purposes of justice and of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I am an old man, and a clergyman; I know nothing about the law;
      but I know it was a wrong act to bind any man's conscience to live a
      perpetual lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Your father was here asked if he had any thing more to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word only. In the prisoner's confession, he has, out of delicacy to me,
      omitted three facts, which weigh materially in extenuation of his crime.
      When he committed it he was only nineteen, and my son was thirty. He was
      drunk, and my son, who led an irregular life, had made him so, and
      afterwards taunted him, more than a youth of nineteen was likely to bear.
      Such was his statement to me, and knowing his character and my son's, I
      have little doubt of its perfect accuracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked up for his notes. &ldquo;You seem, sir, strange to say, to be
      not unfavourable towards the prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just towards the prisoner. I wish to be, even though he has on his
      hands the blood of my only son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the pause which followed, the judge said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Johnston:&mdash;the Court respects your feelings, and regrets to
      detain you longer or put you to any additional pain. But it may materially
      aid the decision of this very peculiar case, if you will answer another
      question. You are aware that, all other evidence being wanting, the
      prisoner can only be judged by his own confession. Do you believe, on your
      oath, that this confession is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I am bound to say from my intimate knowledge of the prisoner, that
      I believe him to be now, whatever he may have been in his youth, a man of
      sterling honour and unblemished life; one who would not tell a lie to save
      himself from the scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Court is satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before he sat down, your father turned, and, for the first time that
      day, he and I were face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a clergyman, as I said, and I never was in a court of justice
      before. Is it illegal for me to address a few words to the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was or not, nobody interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor Urquhart,&rdquo; he said, speaking loud enough for every one to hear,
      &ldquo;what your sentence may be I know not, or whether you and I shall ever
      meet again until the day of judgment. If not, I believe that if we are to
      be forgiven our debts according as we forgive our debtors, I shall have to
      forgive you then. I prefer to do it now, while we are in the flesh, and it
      may comfort your soul. I, Henry Johnston's father, declare publicly that I
      believe what you did was done in the heat of youth, and has ever since
      been bitterly repented of. May God pardon you, even as I do this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not see your father afterwards. He quitted the court directly after
      sentence was given&mdash;three months' imprisonment&mdash;the judge making
      a long speech previously; but I heard not a syllable. I heard nothing but
      your father's words&mdash;saw no one except himself, sitting there below
      me, with his hands crossed on his stick, and a stream of sunshine falling
      across his white hairs&mdash;Theodora&mdash;Theodora&mdash;I cannot write&mdash;it
      is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granton got admission to me for a minute, after I was taken back to
      prison. He told me that the &ldquo;hard labour&rdquo; was remitted, that there had
      been application made for commutation of the three months into one, but
      the judge declined. If I wished, a new application should be made to the
      Home Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, my love, suffer him not to do it. Let nothing more be done. I had
      rather abide my full term of punishment. It is only too easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not grieve for me. Trust me, my child, many a peer puts on his robes
      with a heavier heart than I put on this felon's dress, which shocked
      Granton so much that he is sure to tell you of it. Never mind it&mdash;my
      clothes are not me, are they, little lady? Who was the man that wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Stone walls do not a prison make,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Nor iron bars a cage,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Minds innocent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I innocent? No, but I am forgiven, as I believe, before God and man.
      And are not all the glories of heaven preparing, not for sinless but for
      pardoned souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I am at peace. This first night of my imprisonment is, for some
      things, as happy to me as that which I have often imagined to myself, when
      I should bring you home for the first time to my own fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even that thought, and the rush of thoughts that came with it, are
      able to shake me out of this feeling of unutterable rest: so perfect that
      it seems strange to imagine I shall ever go out of this cell to begin
      afresh the turmoil of the world&mdash;as strange as that the dead should
      wish to return again to life and its cares. But this as God wills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, good night. Granton will give you any further particulars. Talk
      to him freely&mdash;it will be his good heart's best reward. His happy,
      busy life, which is now begun, may have been made all the brighter for the
      momentary cloud which taught him that Providence oftentimes blesses us in
      better ways than by giving us exactly the thing we desired. He told me
      when we parted, which was the only allusion he made to the past&mdash;that
      though Mrs. Colin was &ldquo;the dearest little woman in all the world,&rdquo; he
      should always adore as &ldquo;something between a saint and an angel,&rdquo; Miss
      Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is she my saint and angel? Perhaps&mdash;if she were not likewise the
      woman of my love.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is she doing now, I wonder? Probably vanishing, lamp in hand, as I
      have often watched her, up the stair into her own wee room&mdash;where she
      shuts the door and remembers me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, remember me&mdash;but not with pain. Believe that I am happy&mdash;that
      whatever now befalls me, I shall always be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell your father&mdash;No, tell him nothing. He surely knows all. Or he
      will know it&mdash;when, this life having passed away like a vapour, he
      and I stand together before the One God&mdash;who is also the Redeemer of
      sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write to me, but do not come and see me. Hitherto, your name has been kept
      clear out of everything; it must be still, at any sacrifice to both of us.
      I count on this from you. You know, you once said, laughing, you had
      already taken in your heart the marriage vow of &ldquo;obedience,&rdquo; if I chose to
      exact it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never did, but I do now. Unless I send for you&mdash;which I solemnly
      promise to do if illness or any other cause makes it necessary&mdash;obey
      me, your husband: do not come and see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months will pass quickly. Then? But let us not look forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, good-night.
    </p>
    <p>

      CHAPTER XII. HER STORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ax says I am to
      write an end to my journal, tie it up with his letters and mine, fasten a
      stone to it, and drop it over the ship's bulwarks into this blue, blue
      sea.&mdash;That is, either he threatened me or I him&mdash;I forget which,
      with such a solemn termination; but I doubt if we shall ever have courage
      to do it. It would feel something like dropping a little child into this
      &ldquo;wild and wandering grave,&rdquo; as a poor mother on board had to do yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall see him again,&rdquo; she sobbed, as I was helping her to sew the
      little white body up in its hammock. &ldquo;The good God will take care of him
      and let me find him again, even out of the deep sea. I cannot lose him; I
      loved him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, I believe, no perfect love, or the record of it, in heart or in
      word, can ever be lost. So it is of small matter to Max and me, whether
      this, our true love's history, sinks down into the bottom of the ocean; to
      sleep there&mdash;as we almost expected we should do yesterday, there was
      such a storm; or is sealed up and preserved for the benefit of&mdash;of
      our great-grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! that poor mother and her dead child!
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Max here crept down into the berth to look for me&mdash;and I
      returned with him and left him resting comfortably on the quarter-deck,
      promising not to stir for a whole hour. I have to take care of him still;
      but, as I told him, the sea winds are bringing; some of its natural
      brownness back to his dear old face:&mdash;and I shall not consider him
      &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the three months that Max was in prison, I never saw him. Indeed,
      we never once met from the day we said good-bye in my father's presence,
      till the day that&mdash;&mdash;But I will continue my story
      systematically.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those three months Max was ill; not dangerously&mdash;for he said so,
      and I could believe him. It would have gone very hard with me if I could
      not have relied on him in this, as in everything. Nevertheless, it was a
      bitter time, and now I almost wonder how I bore it. Now, when I am ready
      and willing for everything, except the one thing, which, thank God, I
      shall never have to bear again&mdash;separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before he came out of prison, Max wrote to me a long and serious
      letter. Hitherto, both our letters had been filled up with trivialities,
      such as might amuse him and cheer me, we deferred all plans till he was
      better. My private thoughts, if I had any, were not clear even to myself,
      until Max's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very sad letter. Three months' confinement in one cell, with one
      hour's daily walk round a circle in a walled yard&mdash;prisoner's labour,
      for he took to making mats, saying it amused him; prisoner's rules and
      fare&mdash;no wonder that towards the end even his brave heart gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke down utterly. Otherwise he never would have written to me as he
      did&mdash;bidding me farewell, <i>me!</i> At first I was startled and
      shocked; then I laid down the letter and smiled&mdash;a very sad sort of
      smile of course, but still it was a smile. The idea that Max and I could
      part, or desire to do so, under any human circumstances, seemed one of
      those amusingly impossible things that one would never stop to argue in
      the least, either with one's self or any other person. That we loved one
      another, and therefore some day should probably be married, but that
      anyhow we belonged to one another till death, were facts at once as
      simple, natural, and immutable, as that the sun stood in the heavens or
      that the grass was green.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote back to Max that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that I did it in any hurry, or impulse of sudden feeling. I took many
      hours to consider both what I should say, and in what form I should put
      it. Also, I had doubts whether it would not be best for him, if he
      accepted the generous offer of Mr. Thorley's son-in-law, made with full
      knowledge of all circumstances, to go first to America alone. But, think
      how I would, my thoughts all returned and settled in the same track, in
      which was written one clear truth; that after God and the right&mdash;which
      means all claims of justice and conscience&mdash;the first duty of any two
      who love truly is towards one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought since, that if this truth were plainer seen and more firmly
      held, by those whom it concerns&mdash;many false notions about honour,
      pride, self-respect, would slip off; many uneasy doubts and divided duties
      would be set at rest; there would be less fear of the world and more of
      God, the only righteous fear. People would believe more simply in His
      ordinance, instituted &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo;&mdash;not the mere outward
      ceremony of a wedding; but the love which draws together man and woman,
      until it makes them complete in one another, in the mystical marriage
      union, which, once perfect, should never he disannulled. And if this union
      begins, as I think it does, from the very hour each feels certain of the
      other's love&mdash;surely, as I said to Max&mdash;to talk about giving one
      another up, whether from poverty, delay, altered circumstances, or
      compulsion of friends, anything in short except changed love, or lost
      honour&mdash;like poor Penelope and Francis&mdash;was about as foolish and
      wrong as attempting to annul a marriage. Indeed, I have seen many a
      marriage that might have been broken with far less unholiness than a real
      troth plight, such as was this of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little more &ldquo;preaching,&rdquo; (a bad habit that I fear is growing upon
      me, save that Max merely laughs at it, or when he does not laugh he
      actually listens!) I ended my letter by the-earnest advice, that he should
      go and settle in Canada, and go at once; but that he must remember he had
      to take with him one trifling incumbrance&mdash;me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the words were written, the deed done, I was a little startled at
      myself. It looked so exceedingly like my making <i>him</i> an offer of
      marriage! But then&mdash;good-bye, foolish doubt! good-bye contemptible,
      shame! Those few tears that burnt my cheeks after the letter was gone,
      were the only tears of the sort that I ever shed&mdash;that Max will ever
      suffer me to shed. Max loves me!
    </p>
    <p>
      His letter in reply I shall not give&mdash;not a line of it. It was only
      <i>for me</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that being settled, the next thing to consider was how matters could be
      brought about, without delay either. For, with Max's letter, I got one
      from his good friend Mrs. Ansdell, at whose house in London he had gone to
      lodge. Her son had followed his two sisters&mdash;they were a consumptive
      family&mdash;leaving her a poor old childless widow now. She was very fond
      of my dear Max, which made her quick-sighted concerning him, and so she
      wrote as she did, delicately, but sufficiently plainly, to me, whom she
      said he had told her was, in case of any sudden calamity, to be sent for
      as &ldquo;his dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My dear Max! Now, we smile at these sad forebodings; we believe we shall
      both live to see a good old age. But if I had known that we should only be
      married a year, a month, a week,&mdash;if I had been certain he would die
      in my arms the very same day&mdash;I should still have done exactly what I
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one sense, his illness made my path easier. He had need of me, vital,
      instant need, and no one else had. Also, he was so weak that even his will
      had left him; he could neither reason nor resist. He just wrote, &ldquo;You are
      my conscience; do as you will, only do right.&rdquo; And then, as Mrs. Ansdell
      afterwards told me, he lay for days and days, calm, patient; waiting, he
      says, for another angel than Theodora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;we smile now, at these days, as I said; thank God, we can
      smile; but it would not do to live them over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max refused to let me come to see him at Mrs. Ansdell's, until my father
      had been informed of all our plans. But papa went on in his daily life,
      now so active and cheerful; he did not seem to remember anything
      concerning Doctor Urquhart and me. For two whole days did I follow him
      about, watching an opportunity, but it never came. The first person who
      learnt my secret was Penelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many a time, in these strange summers to come, shall I call to mind
      that soft English summer night, under the honeysuckle-bush,&mdash;Penelope
      and I sitting at our work; she talking the while of Lisabel's new hope,
      and considering which of us two should best be spared to go and take care
      of her in her trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, indeed, papa might almost be left alone, for a week or two. He would
      hardly miss us&mdash;he is so well. I should not wonder, if, like
      grandfather, whom you don't remember, Dora,&mdash;he lived to be ninety
      years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he may; I hope he may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I burst out sobbing; then, hanging about my sister's neck, I told her
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I cried, for my tongue seemed unloosed, and I was not afraid of
      speaking to her, nor even of hurting her&mdash;if now she could be hurt by
      the personal sorrows that mine recalled to her mind. &ldquo;Oh, Penelope, don't
      you think it would be right? Papa does not want me&mdash;nobody wants me.
      Or if they did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped. Penelope said, meditatively:&mdash;&ldquo;A man shall leave his
      father and his mother and cleave unto his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And equally, a woman ought to cleave unto her husband. I mean to ask my
      father's consent to my going with Max to Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that's sudden, child.&rdquo; And by her start of pain I felt how untruly I
      had spoken, and how keenly I must have wounded my sister in saying,
      &ldquo;Nobody wanted me&rdquo; at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home, where I lived for nearly twenty-seven years, all of which now seem
      such happy years. &ldquo;God do so unto me and more also,&rdquo; as the old Hebrews
      used to say, if ever I forget Rockmount, my peaceful maiden-home!
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked so pretty that night, with the sunset colouring its old walls,
      and its terrace-walk, where papa was walking to and fro, bareheaded, the
      rosy light falling like a glory upon his long white hair. To think of him
      thus pacing his garden, year after year, each year growing older and
      feebler, and I never seeing him, perhaps never hearing from him; either
      not coming back at all, or returning after a lapse of years to find
      nothing left to me but my father's grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      The conflict was very terrible; nor would Max himself have wished it less.
      They who do not love their own flesh and blood, with whom they have lived
      ever since they were born, how can they know what any love is?
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard papa call us:&mdash;&ldquo;Come in, you girls! The sun is down, and the
      dews are falling.&rdquo; Penelope put her hand softly on my head. &ldquo;Hush, child,
      hush! Steal into your own room, and quiet yourself. I will go and explain
      things to your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sure she must have done it in the best and gentlest way; Penelope
      does everything so wisely and gently now; but when she came to look for
      me, I knew, before she said a word, that it had been done in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora, you must go yourself and reason with him. But take heed what you
      say and what you do. There is hardly a man on this earth for whom it is
      worth forsaking a happy home and a good father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And truly, if I had ever had the least doubt of Max, or of our love for
      one another; if I had not felt as it were already married to him, who had
      no tie in the whole wide world but me&mdash;I never could have nerved
      myself to say what I did say to my father. If, in the lightest word, it
      was unjust, unloving or undutiful&mdash;may God forgive me, for I never
      meant it! My heart was breaking almost&mdash;but I only wanted to hold
      fast to the right, as I saw it, and as, so seeing it, I could not but act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, I understand you wish to leave your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&mdash;papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not argue the point. I thought that folly was all over now. It must be
      over. Be a good girl, and forget it. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I must have turned very white, for I felt him take hold of me,
      and press me into a chair beside him. But it would not do to let my
      strength go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I want your consent to my marriage with Dr. Urquhart. He would come
      and ask you himself; but he is too ill. We have waited a long time, and
      suffered much. He is not young, and I feel old&mdash;quite old myself,
      sometimes. Do not part us any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, as near as I can recollect, what I said&mdash;said very quietly
      and humbly, I know it was; for my father seemed neither surprised nor
      angry; but he sat there as hard as a stone, repeating only, &ldquo;It <i>must</i>
      be over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered by one word:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Harry</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I dared to speak out plain, even to my father. &ldquo;Papa, you said,
      publicly, you had forgiven him for the death of Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never said I should forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, there it is!&rdquo; I cried out bitterly. &ldquo;People say they forgive, but
      they cannot forget. It would go hard with some of us if the just God dealt
      with us in like manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are profane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! only I am not afraid to bring God's truth into all the circumstances
      of life, and to judge them by it. I believe,&mdash;if Christ came into the
      world to forgive sinners, we ought to forgive them too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far I said&mdash;not thinking it just towards Max that I should plead
      merely for pity to be shewn to him or to me who loved him; but because it
      was the right and the truth, and as such, both for Max's honour and mine,
      I strove to put it clearly before my father. And then I gave way, pleading
      only as a daughter with her father, that he should blot out the past, and
      not for the sake of one long dead and gone break the heart of his living
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry would not wish it&mdash;I am sure he would not. If Harry has gone
      where he, too, may find mercy for his many sins, I know that he has long
      ago forgiven my dear Max.&rdquo; My father, muttering something about &ldquo;strange
      theology,&rdquo; sat thoughtful. It was some time before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one point of the subject you omit entirely. What will the world
      say? I, a clergyman, to sanction the marriage of my daughter with the man
      who took the life of my son? It is not possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I grew bold:&mdash;&ldquo;So, it is not the law of God, or justice, or
      nature, that keeps us asunder&mdash;but the world? Father, you have no
      right to part Max and me for fear of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When it was said, I repented myself of this. But it was too late. All his
      former hardness returned as he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware that I have no legal right to forbid your marriage. You are of
      age: you may act, as you have all along acted, in defiance of your
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never in defiance, nor even in secret disobedience and I reminded him how
      all things had been carried on&mdash;open and plain&mdash;from first to
      last; how patiently we had waited, and how, if Max were well and
      prosperous, I might still have said, &ldquo;We will wait a little longer. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went down on my very knees, and with tears and sobs besought my father
      to let me be Max's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night: go to your bed, Dora, and weary me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose, certain now that the time was come when I must choose between two
      duties&mdash;between father and husband; the one to whom I owed existence,
      the other to whose influence I owed everything that had made me a girl
      worth living, or worth loving. Such crises do come to poor souls!&mdash;God
      guide them, for He only can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, father&rdquo;&mdash;my lips felt dry and stiff&mdash;it was
      scarcely my own voice that I heard, &ldquo;I will wait&mdash;there are still a
      few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned suddenly upon me. &ldquo;What are you planning? Tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to do so.&rdquo; And then, briefly,&mdash;for each word came out with
      pain, as if it were a last breath,&mdash;I explained that Dr. Urquhart
      would have to leave for Canada in a month&mdash;that, if we had gained my
      father's consent, we intended to be married in three weeks, remain a week
      in England, and then sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I do not give my consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped a moment, and then strength came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be Max's wife still. God gave us to one another, and God only
      shall put us asunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, I remember nothing till I found myself lying in my own bed
      with Penelope beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      No words can tell how good my sister Penelope was to me in the three weeks
      that followed. She helped me in all my marriage preparations; few and
      small, for I had little or no money except what I might have asked papa
      for, and I would not have done that&mdash;not for worlds! Max's wife would
      have come to him almost as poor as Griseldis, had not Penelope one day
      taken me to those locked-up drawers of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid of ill-luck with these things? No? Then choose whatever
      you want, and may you have health and happiness to wear them, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so&mdash;with a little more stitching&mdash;for I had a sort of
      superstition that I should like to be married in one new white gown, which
      my sister and I made between us&mdash;we finished and packed the small
      wardrobe which was all the marriage portion poor Theodora Johnston could
      bring to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father must have been well aware of our preparations, for we did not
      attempt to hide them; the household knew only that Miss Dora, was &ldquo;going a
      journey,&rdquo; but he knew better&mdash;that she was going to leave him and her
      old home, perhaps for evermore. Yet he said nothing. Sometimes I caught
      him looking earnestly at me&mdash;at the poor face which I saw in the
      looking-glass&mdash;growing daily more white and heavy-eyed&mdash;yet he
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope told me when, hearing me fall, she had run into the library that
      night, he bade her &ldquo;take the child away, and say she must not speak to him
      on this subject any more.&rdquo; I obeyed. I behaved all through those three
      weeks as if each day had been like the innumerable other days that I had
      sat at my father's table, walked and talked by his side, if not the best
      loved, at least as well loved as any of his daughters. But it was an
      ordeal such as even to remember gives one a shiver of pain, wondering how
      one bore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day-time I was quiet enough, being so busy, and, as I said,
      Penelope was very good to me; but at night I used to lie awake, seeing,
      with open eyes, strange figures about the room&mdash;especially my mother,
      or some one I fancied was she. I would often talk to her, asking her if I
      were acting right or wrong, and whether all that I did for Max she would
      not have once done for my father? then rouse myself with a start, and a
      dread that my wits were going, or that some heavy illness was approaching
      me, and if so, what would become of Max?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length arrived the last day&mdash;the day before my marriage. It was
      not to be here, of course; but in some London church, near Mrs. Ansdell's,
      who was to meet me herself at the railway-station early the same morning,
      and remain with me till I was Dr. Urquhart's wife. I could have no other
      friend; Penelope and I agreed that it was best not to risk my father's
      displeasure by asking for her to go to my marriage. So, without sister or
      father, or any of my own kin, I was to start on my sad wedding-morning&mdash;quite
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the week, I had taken an opportunity to drive over to the Cedars,
      shake hands with Colin and his wife, and give his dear old mother one long
      kiss, which she did not know was a good-bye. Otherwise I bade farewell to
      no one. My last walk through the village was amidst a deluge of August
      rain, in which my moorlands vanished, all mist and gloom. A heavy, heavy
      night: it will be long before the weight of it is lifted off my
      remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I knew I was doing right, and, if needed, would do it all over
      again. Every human love has its sacrifices and its anguishes, as well as
      its joys&mdash;the one great love of life has often most of all.
      Therefore, let those beware who enter upon it lightly, or selfishly, or
      without having counted its full cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know if we shall be happy,&rdquo; said I to Penelope, when she was
      cheering me with a future that may never come&mdash;&ldquo;I only know that Max
      and I have cast our lots together, and that we shall love one another to
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in that strong love armed, I lived&mdash;otherwise, many times that
      day, it would have seemed easier to have died.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went, as usual, to bid papa goodnight, I could hardly stand. He
      looked at me suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, my dear. By-the-by, Dora, I shall want you to drive me to the
      Cedars tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Penelope will do it.&rdquo; And I fell on his breast with a
      pitiful cry. &ldquo;Only bid me good-bye! Only say 'God bless you,' just once,
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He breathed hard. &ldquo;I thought so. Is it to be to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes papa let me lie where I was; patting my shoulder softly,
      as one does a sobbing child&mdash;then, still gently, he put me away from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better end this, Dora; I cannot bear it. Kiss me. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not one blessing? Papa, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father rose, and laid his hand solemnly on my head:&mdash;&ldquo;You have
      been a dutiful girl to me, in all things save this, and a good daughter
      makes a good wife. Farewell&mdash;wherever you go,&mdash;God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he closed the library-door upon me I thought I had taken my last
      look of my dear father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only six o'clock in the morning when Penelope took me to the
      station. Nobody saw us&mdash;nobody knew. The man at the railway stopped
      us, and talked to Penelope for full two minutes about his wife's illness&mdash;two
      whole minutes out of our last five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;My sister would not bid me good-bye&mdash;being determined, she
      said, to see me again, either in London or Liverpool, before we sailed.
      She had kept me up wonderfully, and her last kiss was almost cheerful, or
      she made it seem so. I can still see her&mdash;very pale, for she had been
      up since daylight, but otherwise quiet and tearless, pacing the solitary
      platform&mdash;our two long shadows gliding together before us, in the
      early morning sun. And I see her, even to the last minute, standing with
      her hand on the carriage-door&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Doctor Urquhart my love&mdash;tell him, I know he will take care of
      you. And child&rdquo;&mdash;turning round once again with her &ldquo;practical&rdquo; look
      that I knew so well, &ldquo;Remember, I have written 'Miss Johnston,' on your
      boxes. Afterwards, be sure that you alter the name. Good-bye,&mdash;nonsense,
      it is not really goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ay, but it was. For how many, many years?
    </p>
    <p>
      In that dark, gloomy, London church, which a thundery mist made darker and
      stiller&mdash;I first saw again my dear Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ansdell said, lest I should be startled and shocked, that it was only
      the sight of me which overcame him; that he was really better. And so
      when, after the first few minutes, he asked me, hesitatingly, &ldquo;if I did
      not find him much altered?&rdquo; I answered boldly, &ldquo;No! that I should soon get
      accustomed to his grey hair; besides, I never remembered him either
      particularly handsome or particularly young.&rdquo; At which he smiled&mdash;and
      then I knew again my own Max! and all things ceased to feel so mournfully
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went into one of the far pews, and Max tried on my ring. How his hands
      shook! so much that all my trembling passed away, and a great calm came
      over me. Yes&mdash;I had done right. He had nobody but me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we sat, side by side, neither of us speaking a word, until the
      pew-opener came to say the clergyman was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several other couples waiting to be married at the same time&mdash;who
      had bridesmaids, and friends, and fathers. We three walked up and took our
      places&mdash;there was no one to pay heed to us. I saw the verger whisper
      something to Max&mdash;to which he answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and the old man came
      and stood behind Mrs. Ansdell and me. A few other folk were dotted about
      in the pews, but I only noticed them as moving figures, and distinguished
      none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service began&mdash;which I&mdash;indeed we both&mdash;had last heard
      at Lisabel's wedding&mdash;in our pretty church, all flower-adorned, she
      looking so handsome and happy, with her sisters near her, and her father
      to give her away. For a moment I felt very desolate: and hearing a
      pew-door open and a footstep come slowly up the aisle, I trembled with a
      vague fear that something might happen, something which even at the last
      moment might part Max and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not; I heard him repeat the solemn promises&mdash;how dare any
      one make them lightly, or break them afterwards! to &ldquo;<i>love, comfort,
      honor and keep me, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all other,
      keep me only unto him, so long as we both should live</i>&rdquo; And I felt that
      I also, out of the entire trust I had in him, and the great love I bore
      him, could cheerfully forsake all other, father, sisters, kindred, and
      friends, for him. They were very dear to me, and would be always: but he
      was part of myself,&mdash;my husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here let me relate a strange thing&mdash;so unexpected that Max and I
      shall always feel it as a special blessing from heaven to crown all our
      pain and send us forth on our new life in peace and joy. When in the
      service came the question:&mdash;&ldquo;Who giveth this woman, &amp;c&rdquo;&mdash;there
      was no answer, and the silence went like a stab to my heart. The minister,
      thinking there was some mistake, repeated it again:&mdash;&ldquo;Who giveth this
      woman to be married to this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not a stranger's voice, but my dear father's.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My husband had asked me where I should best like to go for our marriage
      journey. I said, to St. Andrews. Max grew much better there. He seemed
      better from the very hour, when, papa having remained with us till our
      train started, we were for the first time left alone by our two selves. An
      expression ungrammatical enough to be quite worthy, Max would say, of his
      little lady, but people who are married will understand what it means.&mdash;We
      did, I think, as we sat still, my head on his shoulder and my hand between
      both his, watching the fields, trees, hills, and dales, fly past like
      changing shadows; never talking at all, nor thinking much, except&mdash;the
      glad thought came in spite of all the bitterness of of these good-byes&mdash;that
      there was one goodbye which never need be said again. We were married.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted with St. Andrews. We shall always talk of our four days
      there, so dream-like at the time, yet afterwards become clear in
      remembrance down to the minutest particulars. The sweetness of them will
      last us through many a working hour, many an hour of care&mdash;such as we
      know must come, in ours as in all human lives. We are not afraid: we are
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last day in St. Andrews was Sunday, and Max took me to his own
      Presbyterian church, in which he and his brother were brought up, and of
      which Dallas was to have been a minister. From his many wanderings it so
      happened that my husband had not heard the Scotch service for many years,
      and he was much affected by it. I too&mdash;when, reading together the
      psalms at the end of his Bible, he shewed me, silently, the name written
      in it&mdash;Dallas Urquhart..
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalm&mdash;I shall long remember it, with the tune it was sung to&mdash;which
      was strange to me, but Max knew it well of old, and it had been a
      particular favourite with Dallas. Surely if spirit, freed from flesh, be
      everywhere, or, if permitted, can go anywhere that it desires,&mdash;not
      very far from us two, as we sat singing that Sunday, must have been our
      brother Dallas.

      Contrary to our plans, we did not see Rockmount again, nor Penelope, nor
      my dear father. It was thought best not. Especially as in a few years at
      latest, we hope, God willing, to visit them all again, or perhaps even to
      settle in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a single day spent at Treherne Court, Augustus went with us one
      sunshiny morning on board the American steamer, which lay so peacefully in
      the middle of the Mersey&mdash;just as if she were to lie there for ever,
      instead of sailing, and we with her&mdash;in one little half hour. Sailing
      far away, far away to a home we knew not, leaving the old familiar faces
      and the old familiar land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed doubly precious now, and beautiful; even the sandy flats, that
      Max had so often told me about, along the Mersey shore. I saw him look
      thoughtfully towards them, after pointing out to me the places he knew,
      and where his former work had lain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all over now,&rdquo; he said, half sadly. &ldquo;Nothing has happened as I
      planned, or hoped, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or feared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. My dear wife, no! Yet all has been for good. All is very good. I
      shall find new work in a new country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max smiled. &ldquo;Yes, she too. We'll work together, my little lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half hour was soon over&mdash;the few last words soon said. But I did
      not at all realize that we were away, till I saw Augustus wave us
      good-bye, and heard the sudden boom of our farewell gun as the <i>Europa</i>
      slipped off her mail-tender, and went steaming seaward alone&mdash;fast,
      oh! so fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of that gun, it must have nearly broken many a heart, many a
      time! I think it would have broken mine, had I not, standing,
      close-clasped, by my husband's side, looked up in his dear face, and read,
      as he in mine, that to us thus together, everywhere was Home.
